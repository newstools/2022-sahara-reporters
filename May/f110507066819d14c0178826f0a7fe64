The ruling All Progressives Congress in Kaduna State is currently in crisis as one of the governorship aspirants, Alhaji Sani Sha’aban, has rejected the congress that created 2,619 delegates, saying there was no election.On Saturday, an Appeal Committee for the ad hoc delegate congresses of the party had approved the congress and declared its exercise as successful. According to Punch, the appeal committee led by Mrs Tinuke Gbadejo-Ogunrinde ruled that a total of 1,275 delegates were elected for the local and state levels each while 69 national delegates were unanimously elected, bringing the number to 2,619 delegates in all.The Committee added that the exercise was done by agreement in accordance with APC’s elections guidelines and constitution, noting that no complaint was received before, during or after the congresses.But Sha’aban, an in-law to President Muhammadu Buhari, kicked against the entire exercise.Sha'a ban did this through his Director-General, Sani Sha’aban Campaign Organisation, Chief Danladi Ephraim.Speaking to journalists in Kaduna on Monday, Ephraim said no delegates primary election that produced the 2,619 delegates was held anywhere across the state.He added that contrary to the panel’s assertion that there was no complaint or petition, the Sani Sha’aban Campaign Organisation submitted a petition that “the committee refused to collect.”
