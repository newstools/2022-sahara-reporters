The accused, who were all Muslims, had pleaded guilty. At the time, Ahmad showed his support for the killing of the nine persons via a post on his Twitter handle.He wrote, “I can't pretend or keep silent. I support the death penalty for BLASPHEMY. That's my belief and I do not and will never support #SaveKanoNine.”SaharaReporters had reported earlier today, Thursday how a female student of the Shehu Shagari College of Education in‪ Sokoto State, identified as Dorcas, was beaten to death and burnt by her colleagues for allegedly insulting Prophet Muhammad (SAW).  I cant pretend or keep silent. I support the death penalty for BLASPHEMY. That's my belief and I do not and will never support #SaveKanoNine
