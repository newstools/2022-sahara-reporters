The organisers of one of Nigeria’s prestigious awards, Headies, have written a petition to the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, concerning the threat to the life of some nominees of the award ceremony by artiste, Habeeb Okikiola popularly known as Portable.The petition dated, May 26, 2022, and obtained by Daily Trust, is titled, “Threat to life and acts likely to cause a breach of peace by Mr Habeeb Okikiola, popularly known as ‘Portable’ against other nominees of the Headies award.” 





The organisers of the event pointed at a video released on the singer’s social media platforms whereby he uttered the words, “Those are my awards. Anybody else who wins, I will ask for them to be killed. I will ask them to kill the person. If the organisers give my award to someone else, they will die.”The artiste was nominated in two categories at the 15th edition of The Headies which is billed to hold later this year in the United States of America.In the petition, the organisers of the award demanded a retraction from the up-and-coming artiste. Moreso, he is to be invited to the police headquarters to give an undertaking not to engage in any unlawful act that will cause a breach of peace.Furthermore, it was demanded by the organisers of The Headies that Portable should publish a written apology to all the nominees in the two categories.The organisers of the award further stated that if the singer does not meet their demands, they will not only disqualify him from participating in the Headies but “also enforce the instrumentalities of the law to the fullest.”
