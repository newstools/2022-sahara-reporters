According to Adamu Jere, there was tension in the community as youths enraged and lamented that despite the combined security presence of military, divisional police office and area command, they failed to wade off the terrorists who operated for over three hours.“We made several calls to the various security agencies on ground and they all ignored us. This is the second major attack on our community in the last three months and we feel that the security agents stationed here are of no use to us,” Adamu Jere said.Another resident, Ibrahim Salisu, who said the community would stage a formal protest against security agents in the community, added that the action of the security agents portrays them as people who “are either colluding with the bandits or people who do not care about the security of the people.”According to Salisu, it was hours after the terrorists had escaped with their victims that the security personnel made efforts to trail them and later informed the community that they had successfully killed two of the bandits.Meanwhile, the Kaduna State Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammed Jalige, has not confirmed the attack as at the time of filing this report.
