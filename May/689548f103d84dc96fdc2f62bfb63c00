The Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, has debunked reports claiming he endorsed a presidential aspirant of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and former Lagos State governor, Bola Tinubu, for the 2023 general elections. The monarch, in an interview with Arise TV, said his office as the Ooni of Ife mandated him to support and pray for all aspirants contesting in the 2023 presidential election.  “I’m a royal father; I accepted this throne as a young individual. God actually brought me to the throne that has been in existence for hundreds of thousands of years, I have to support and pray for all,” the monarch said. He, however, advised Nigerians to look beyond ethnic and religious bias and vote for the best candidates. A report had circulated on the internet some months ago with the claim that Tinubu's presidential ambition had been endorsed by the Ooni and Owa Obokun of Ijesaland, Oba Adekunle Aromolaran, when he visited their respective palaces. Ogunwusi was reported to have described the former Lagos governor as a special breed while consenting to his presidential aspiration. However, the traditional ruler had alienated himself from such, stating that all aspirants had his blessings.
