Some youths in Kano State have held a protest and given a seven-day ultimatum to former President Goodluck Jonathan to declare interest in the 2023 Presidency, Daily Trust reports. The youths, in their hundreds, thronged the Kano State Secretariat of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) on Saturday, after staging a rally around some strategic places in the city.

Some of the banners and placards had inscriptions such as “Jonathan Don’t Abandon Us”, “Come To The Rescue Of Our Country”, “Jonathan, You Must Run”, and so on. SaharaReporters had in several reports exposed how a cabal in the All Progressives Congress (APC) had been pushing for Jonathan to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari, but later became disappointed when Jonathan failed to meet some of the conditions they had given to him. Speaking at the NUJ secretariat, the Coordinator of Jonathan Support Organisation, Mubashir Tafida, said Nigeria is in a sorry state and only a man like Jonathan could fix the problems. Tafida added that if the former president did not declare his intention to run, two million youths would storm his office and force him to contest. “Economic instability in Nigeria is taking its toll. That needs a man like Jonathan to be fixed. When he was president, there was no hunger and poverty. Our destiny lies in his hands. He is our father, and as children, we appeal to him to contest for election in order to save us from the present hardship in Nigeria. “So, we give him a seven-day ultimatum to declare for the presidency or we will throng his office with 2 million youths to force him to declare. Our destiny lies in his decision to run.” The Coordinator also stated that they did not care if Jonathan chose to contest on the platform of any political party as long he ran for President.
