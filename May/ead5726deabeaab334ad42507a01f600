Properties and houses in Katangan Warji, Headquarters of Warji Local Government Area of Bauchi State were on Friday evening reportedly destroyed by irate youths over alleged blasphemy.

Another source said that it was one of the youths who recently got converted from Christianity to Islam who allegedly raised the alarm of the alleged blasphemy by a Christian lady and led other Muslim youths in search of her. One of the leaders of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in the state confirmed the situation and said that the state Police Commissioner and the Senior Special Assistant to Governor Bala Muhammed on Christian Religious Affairs had been informed.
