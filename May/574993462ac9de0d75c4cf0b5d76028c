Justice Binta Nyako of the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, has refused to grant bail to the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu.In a ruling on the IPOB leader's bail application on Wednesday, Justice Nyako said she was not convinced as to why Kanu breached his previous bail conditions.

The court therefore insisted that Kanu must explain why he jumped bail before he could enjoy another favourable discretion from the court.According to Nyako, “Until the issue of absence of the defendant for his trial, with all the bail conditions breached, is determined, the instant application of the defendant for bail will at best be premature and it is refused."However, the defendant is at liberty to re-file the application"Kanu has been detained by the Department of State Services (DSS) since June 2021 following his rendition to Nigeria from Kenya.He had fled Nigeria in 2017 during trial after the military invaded his home in Abia State.He is facing 7 counts bordering on treasonable felony, after 8 of the initial 15-counts charge preferred by the Federal Government were struck out.Trial Justice, Nyako, had on April 8, struck out eight out of the 15-count treasonable felony charge the Federal Government preferred against Kanu.Justice Nyako held that the charges were mere repetitions that did not disclose any offence that could be sustained by the proof of evidence before the court.
