Apostle John Okoriko, the founder of Solid Rock Kingdom Church, who was freed after four days in captivity, has recounted his terrible ordeal in the kidnapper's den.Okoriko, who was kidnapped at his residence in the Mkpat Enin Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State, said he was tortured by his abductors so he could accept to pay the initial N100 million ransom they demanded. He, however, said while he was about to be released, two of the five-man gang knelt before him to seek prayers, Daily Trust reports.“The torture was much. They did terrible things to my body to force me to bring money to them. I told them I had not seen such money in my entire life.”“They told me I am the richest pastor in Akwa Ibom. They did all manner of things to me. Out of the five-man gang that abducted me, two of them knelt down and asked me to pray for them before they released me in the evening to go,” he said.He further commended the former Chairman of the State Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Prelate Emeritus of Methodist Church, Sunday Mbang, and founder of Believers Assembly, Apostle Isaiah Isong, for the roles they played in ensuring he was released.He said the duo set up a team of people who gathered to pray for him.Okoriko said after his release, his first point of call was the capital ground of his church because it was close to the kidnappers' den, and Prelate Sunday Mbang, the following morning, because of the dream he had about Mbang.He said, “That night, I saw my father who died in 1990 sitting in place like a court session with great men and women. When he talked to me, he turned to Prelate Sunday Mbang.“In the morning, I showed myself to Prelate Mbang and prostrated before him and told him my experiences. Quoting the scripture from Psalm 129: 2, I told him that from my youth, people have attacked me but they never prevailed over me.”
