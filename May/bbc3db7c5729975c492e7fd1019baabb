There is a path to Nigeria's greatness. Together, let's work on Nigeria's unfinished greatness.”Fayemi will on Wednesday, declare his intention for Presidency at the Congress Hall, Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja.The Ekiti Governor will join the pool of other Presidential hopefuls from the APC.The former governor of Lagos State and National Leader of the party, Bola Tinubu broke the ice in January and declared his intention to run for the presidency when he visited President Muhammadu Buhari at the Aso Villa, Abuja.The Governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi, followed suit, and in a similar fashion, visited Buhari to inform him of his intention to run for the coveted number one position in the country.It did not take long for others like a former governor of Abia State, Senator Orji Kalu; ex-governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha; Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State; and Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, to declare their interest in the presidency on the platform of the APC.Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo has also joined the race.
