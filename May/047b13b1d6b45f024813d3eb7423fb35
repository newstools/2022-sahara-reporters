The Bauchi State Commissioner for Education, Mrs Aliyu Tilde, has supported the lynching of Deborah Samuel, a female student of the Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto State, by her colleagues over alleged blasphemy.According to Tilde, Nigerians not in support of the action should visit a psychiatrist for a test. Posting what Deborah reportedly said, the commissioner wrote, “Ba wai an yi group din nan don ture-turen abubuwan banza ba ne fa. An yi don past Q, in akwai test, in an ba da assignment, a tura. Ba wai abubuwan banzan ga za ku tuttura mana ba. Manzon Allah din me? (This group is not for the faint of heart. Done for past Q, if there is a test, if an assignment is given, push. It's not what you don't care about us. What is the Messenger of Allah?),”The commissioner then added, “If you’re not provoked by this, visit a psychiatrist, please. We must teach our children to respect others.”SaharaReporters had reported how Deborah was killed and burnt by her colleagues for allegedly insulting Prophet Muhammad (SAW).Outraged by the incident, Nigerians on Twitter had asked the Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal, and other relevant stakeholders to ensure justice was served.Similarly in March 2021, some angry youths backed by leaders in Sade community in the Darazo Local Government Area of Bauchi State burnt a man identified as Talle Mai Ruwa, to death for allegedly insulting Prophet Muhammad.SaharaReporters learnt that Mai Ruwa was dragged away from his house in the presence of his mother and burnt to death in the middle of the community.
