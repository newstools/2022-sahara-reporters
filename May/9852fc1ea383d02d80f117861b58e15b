Nigeria's former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, has deleted a post on his Twitter handle where he condemned the lynching of Deborah Samuel, a Christian student of Shehu Shagari College of Education Sokoto by her colleagues. Deborah had been burnt to death by her colleagues for allegedly insulting Prophet Muhammad.  Atiku, who is a presidential hopeful under the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), amid the outrage trailing the student’s murder called for the prosecution of her killers. He wrote on Twitter, “There cannot be a justification for such gruesome murder. Deborah Yakubu was murdered and all those behind her death must be brought to justice. My condolences to her family and friends.” However, some Muslims in his comment section threatened not to vote for him while some said they were awaiting his coming to Sokoto for his presidential campaign.  Succumbing to the threat, the former Vice-President deleted the tweet. On Facebook, the former Vice President in a message on his verified Hausa page distanced himself from the message. He also stated that any message on social media that did not come with the initials “A. A.” was not his. “This evening I received information that a post was made that doesn’t agree with my orders. I use this to announce that any post without A. A. is not from me. May God protect us,” he wrote in Hausa language. However, Nigerians on social media have condemned Atiku's hypocrisy stating that he is more interested in the votes than the safety of those he is calling upon to vote for him. Below are some reactions from Twitter: Atiku deleting the tweet condemning the gruesome murder of Deborah shows what we have been preaching this whole election season. Politicians donât care for the people. They only play to the gallery when seeking for our votes. The people must see beyond these gimmicksâ¦ Atiku was not really sympathetic Tried to appease the South, saw reaction from the North, deletedHe feels itâs better not to offend the North than offend the South because Southerners are slaves and will vote for him anywaysOur Politicians are the wickedest people on earth Atiku Abubakar deleting his social media posts condemning the killin & calling for justice is enough proof that absolutely nothing will be done & life will go on as usual...Sickening! Atiku deleting the post he made to condemn the sokoto killing is a big red flag. Northerners promised to punish Atiku with their votes and he pulled the tweets down.Interesting!
