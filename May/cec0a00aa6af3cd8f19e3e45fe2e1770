Gboyega, the son of a former Governor of Ondo State, Adebayo Adefarati, has defeated the serving House of Representatives member, Ade Adeogun, to win the All Progressives Congress (APC) ticket for the Akoko South-West/South-East Federal Constituency.   Adefarati, who is the immediate past Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs in the state, polled 95 votes to defeat Adeogun who scored only two votes. Other aspirants defeated in primaries conducted under heavy presence of security men included Victor Ategbole who polled 6 votes, Barrister Adanike who scored one vote and Stephen Adeyeri who scored three votes.The primary, which was billed to hold at Oka Akoko on Friday, was later moved to a neutral place in Akure due to a fear of possible breakdown of law and order at the previous venue.It was gathered that there was tension at Oka Akoko, which compelled security operatives, APC primary election committee officials and INEC officials to request for a change of venue to a more safe and peaceful area.The Chairman of the APC primary election committee in the state, Dr. Kingsley Nwankwere, who declared the result, explained that two votes were voided while 21 ballot papers were not used.According to Dr. Nwankwere, the exercise satisfied all necessary laws and thus, Adefarati was declared the APC candidate in the 2023 general elections for the contested federal constituency.In his reaction after the exercise, Hon. Adefarati told newsmen that he was delighted that the exercise was conducted transparently and peacefully.He said that many lives could have been lost if the exercise was conducted at Oka Akoko as scheduled earlier.He alleged that hundreds of heavily armed political thugs had stormed the previous venue, causing security breaches and trying to disrupt the primaries.
