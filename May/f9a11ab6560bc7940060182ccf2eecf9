The Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics (ASUP) has announced that it will embark on a two-week warning strike from May 16 over the Nigerian government's failure to meet its demand. The union disclosed this in a statement on Wednesday after its National Executive Council emergency meeting. 





In the statement signed by its President, Anderson Ezeibe, the polytechnics lecturers said they took the decision following the Nigerian government’s failure to honour the Memorandum of Action (MoA) it signed with the union. ASUP went on strike on April 6, 2021, and suspended it on June 10, 2021, over the same MoA with the government. The Nigerian government had signed an MoA with the lecturers, stating a clear path to a sustainable resolution of the issues on the union’s demands with timelines attached to each of the items. The issues revolve around the non-release of the approved revitalisation fund for the sector; the non-release of the approved N15 billion after 11 months of approval by President Muhammadu Buhari and the non-release of arrears of the new minimum wage. Others include the non-release of 10 months of arrears owed polytechnics and the composite amount covering all federal tertiary institutions. “We are deploying this medium to equally appeal to members of the public to prevail on the government to do the needful within the two weeks period so as to avoid an indefinite shutdown of the sector,” ASUP stated.
