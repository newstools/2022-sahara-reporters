Meanwhile, SaharaReporters learnt that Okore was illegally dismissed by the army authorities in 2015 but was reinstated by the National Industrial Court in 2018. He was among senior officers accused of failing to perform their military duties during the fight against Boko Haram which resulted in the militants’ capture of Baga, the centre of a multinational force in Borno State. The missing officer, then a Major in the army was tried by a special court-martial for cowardice.
