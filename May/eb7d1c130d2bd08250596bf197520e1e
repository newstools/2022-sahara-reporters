President Muhammadu Buhari says he is pained by the collapse of a three-storey building In Lagos, in which no fewer than eight persons have died. The incident occurred on Ibadan Street in the Ebute Metta area of Lagos on Sunday night.  Buhari, in a statement on Monday by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, also lamented the rate at which structures have been collapsing in the country. The President commiserated with the families of the victims of the tragic building collapse, urging relevant authorities to work closely with professional bodies to put a stop to such incidents. Buhari, however, commended the first responders for their courage and responsiveness. “The frequency of building collapses in the country has become increasingly embarrassing, the relevant state authorities must work closely with professional bodies to put a halt to these unfortunate but preventable incidents,” the President stated in his message. He wished the injured victims a speedy recovery and prayed for success in the ongoing rescue operations at the site. A 21-storey building, still under construction also collapsed in the Ikoyi area of Lagos State on Monday, November 1, killing several people.
