Speaking on behalf of the other ministers at a valedictory session for appointees leaving the cabinet to pursue political ambitions, the Minister of Niger Delta, Godswill Akpabio, who is among the presidential candidates on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, APC, described working with the President as a “fantastic and knowledgeable experience.” Akpabio said Buhari is the “best president Nigeria could ever have had at a time of difficult circumstances.” He said that as they resign for others to take over, they will continue to be great disciples of Buhari.“As we step aside from FEC (Federal Executive Council), I want you to know that you have disciples in us. I want you to know that it is time for us to propagate Buharism. “I want you to know that we are going to be working closely with the Minister of Information and Culture to take your message of transformation, love, patience, and administrative sagacity to Nigerians,” he said. The former Governor of Akwa Ibom State further told Buhari that from his interactions with the other ministers leaving the cabinet, their departure was like the story of the Spanish play of “sadness and joy.” “Sadness in the sense that we are going to miss the continuous daily and weekly interaction with a father and learning from him; joy because we now have an opportunity to go to the wider audience in Nigeria to speak more of your achievements for this country,” he said.
