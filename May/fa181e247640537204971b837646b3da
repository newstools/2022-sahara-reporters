Peter Obi, former Anambra governor and one of the top Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential aspirants, has dumped the party for Labour Party. Obi announced his resignation in a letter addressed to the National Chairman of the PDP.  In the letter, the former Anambra governor gave different reasons for his withdrawal from the presidential race. SaharaReporters had earlier in the day reported that Obi was planning to dump the opposition party. The PDP has fixed May 28 and May 29 for its presidential primary. A source close to Obi said the former governor was leaving the PDP for the Labour Party. “He is leaving for the Labour Party,” the source told SaharaReporters.  As earlier reported by SaharaReporters, the source had said Obi was under pressure to dump the PDP and pursue his presidential bid in another political party. The source added that though other aspirants from the South-East had accepted to work for him, his chances of getting the ticket were low. “The results of various primaries of the party conducted so far have shown those most of these delegates are loyal to,” the source had said.
