There were gunshots on Tuesday when operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) broke into the residence of Senator Rochas Okorocha in Abuja after hours of laying siege to the house. It was not immediately clear who fired the shots or if anyone was injured, Channels TV reports.  It was learnt the EFCC operatives also tear-gassed journalists at the house. The EFCC had arrived at Okorocha’s residence in Maitama on Tuesday morning to arrest him. According to the agency, Okorocha had refused to “honour invitations after jumping the administrative bail earlier granted him by the Commission.” But Okorocha, who is running for President on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), accused the agency of holding him hostage in his own home. In an interview with Channels TV, the former governor had asked the EFCC to produce an arrest warrant. The EFCC had on January 24, 2022, filed a 17-count criminal charge bordering on diversion of public funds and properties to the tune of N2.9billion against Okorocha. The case was assigned to Honourable Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja but attempts to arraign Senator Okorocha were stalled owing to the absence of the ex-governor who evaded service of processes. At the last adjourned date, March 28th, 2022, Justice Ekwo before adjourning until May 30th, 2022, had warned that it was “the last adjournment I shall grant in this matter”. According to the EFCC, it was “left with no option than to effect the arrest of Senator Okorocha and bring him to trial.”
