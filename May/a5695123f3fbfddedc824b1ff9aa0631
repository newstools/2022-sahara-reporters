Some residents of Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja have trooped to the Minister's office located at Area 11 to protest against the judgement of a Federal High Court which granted a one-year tenure extension to the incumbent area council chairmen.The protesters on Friday displayed placards and blocked the entrance of the building, causing tension in the area.  They also blocked Gwagwalada-Giri Expressway and set a bonfire on the road, making it impassable for motorists.The protesters are calling for the swearing-in of the six elected chairmen, an event earlier scheduled for Friday, May 20 (today).  They also faulted the decision of the FCT minister, Bello Mohammed to suspend the inauguration and swearing-in ceremony of the elected chairmen.According to the judgment, based on the recently signed Electoral Act 2022, which stipulates that the tenure of office of the chairmen of the Area Councils in FCT would now be four years, instead of three years, the existing chairmen, whose tenure was meant to expire on Thursday, have one more year to spend in office.
