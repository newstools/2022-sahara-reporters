Malami, who is also the Attorney-General of Federation (AGF), had in April declared interest in the Kebbi State governorship race. However, last Friday, he pulled out of the Kebbi State governorship race, multiple sources had told SaharaReporters.

He had also submitted his N50 million party nomination form at the International Conference Centre.  Several sources close to the minister said he withdrew from the race over fear that he may not get the ticket.
