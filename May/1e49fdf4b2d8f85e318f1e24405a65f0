However, Emefiele who shunned the invitation of the leadership of the House over the crisis in the aviation sector, sent a representative, Kingsley Obiora.At the commencement of the meeting today, the Speaker walked out Obiora with a clear message directed to the CBN governor.“We all pull out of our recess to be here. Nothing could be more important than being here,” the Speaker said.Emefiele has been heavily criticised for reportedly obtaining the N100 million nomination form of the All Progressives Congress from the party’s organising secretary at the International Conference Centre (ICC) in Abuja.He, however, came out to debunk the reports claiming it was “patriots” who bought the All Progressives Congress party’s nomination forms for him, adding that he would use his own money to buy his nomination forms when he had made a decision to run for the number one office.This sparked the outrage of Nigerians who highlighted the massive corruption cases the CBN governor is currently enmeshed in.
