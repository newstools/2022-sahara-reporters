Pastor Timothy Olaniyan, the Head of Politics and Governance of the Redeemed Christian Church, RCCG, has reacted to criticisms from different quarters over a comment he made regarding the candidacy of Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo for the 2023 general elections. Olaniyan, at the weekend, had said that Osinbajo remained the only child of God and a pastor that could change the narrative of governance in Nigeria. Yemi Osinbajo Olaniyan was quoted to have said: “Money politics in this country has led us to where we are now. “People will promise heaven and earth, and at the end of the day, you see them giving N1000, N2000 to eligible voters. After the election, you won’t see any of their promises being fulfilled, and the people they gave money will not have access to these notable politicians. “It is high time our eyes were opened. What we want is not those baits, we want somebody that would make a promise to our children and fulfill it. If you tell me education is going to be free, I want you to get there and make it free so that we would not continue to build up youths who have no future. “As of today, Pastor Yemi Osinbajo is not just a pastor; he is still a child of God. There are many pastors who can decide to do rituals with a human skull and still claim to be a pastor. I am talking of a child of God.” However, clarifying the statement which he made at the event organised by New Era Nigeria, Olaniyan said he did not speak for the church but for himself.
