Russia has announced that it will stop supplying gas to Finland from May 21, 2022 over the country’s (Finland) application to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO).Announcing the development on Friday, Finnish energy provider Gasum said, “It is highly regrettable that natural gas supplies under our supply contract will now be halted. However, we have been carefully preparing for this situation and provided that there will be no disruptions in the gas transmission network.” Gasum added that it had set up alternate supply networks; hence, the Russian gas supply cutoff will not affect its energy supply.Finland, a neighbouring country to Russia, earlier this week applied to join the NATO amid the ongoing Russian invasion in Ukraine.Bloomberg reported that Finland is the third European country to lose gas supply from Russia after refusing to pay for the fuel in rubles.
