At least, six Nigerian Army personnel from the 93 Battalion, Takum, Taraba State, have been killed following an ambush by gunmen suspected to be terrorists. SaharaReporters gathered that the incident happened in Tati village around 6:30am on Tuesday.  The gunmen were said to have overpowered the troops, killing six soldiers, while a lieutenant colonel identified as ES Okore (N/11717) was “missing in action” amid fears that he had been abducted. Those killed were; Dauda Tata (7NA/44/4046), Yusuf Salihu (95NA/40/5031), Ndubuise Okonkwo (96NA/42/6911), Abdullahi Ibrahim (13NA/70/7901), Emmanuel Jerry (14NA/72/14051) and Sani Isa (14NA/72/15462) as the casualties. A military signal obtained by SaharaReporters said the gunmen also ambushed and attacked troops reinforcement deployed from Mararaba in Nasarawa State, but that the troops carried out anti-ambush drills to fight their way out. The signal read, “ATTK . AT ABOUT 100620A MAY 22. TPS OF 93 BN RESPONDED TO AN ATTK AT TATI VILL IN TAKUM LGA TARABA STATE BY. ON ARR, TPS HAD MTG ENGAGEMENT WITH THE BANDITS WHO OUT NUMBER OWN TPS.
