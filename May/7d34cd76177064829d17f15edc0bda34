A High Court sitting in Uyo, Akwa Ibom has consented to the terms of settlement in the case of alleged abuse and molestation of a junior student of the Deeper Life High School, Uyo, Don-Davies Archibong by two senior students and some teachers.  In his ruling, the presiding Judge, Justice Ntong Ntong struck out the criminal charge, upholding the terms of settlement between the two parties, adding that the consent judgement is final.  The judgment was in a suit between Don-Davis Archibong, plaintiff and Registered Trustees of Deeper Christian Life Ministry and eight others, as defendants.  The court held that “a consent judgement is final and cannot be set aside by the court, which gave the judgment.”  Counsel for the plaintiff, Barrister C.N. Nweke Jnr. told the court that “all the parties have reconciled for the sake of God and the welfare of the plaintiff, who is a minor.”  Also speaking, counsel for the defendants, Taiwo Kupolati (SAN) said “parties have settled amicably and have signed the terms of settlement dated 21st March 2022.”  One of the defendants, Ndidi Solomon, the Principal of Deeper Life High School, Uyo, thanked “God for using Justice Ntong to bring the case to a joyful end.” Last weekend, a peace and reconciliation reception was organised by the Deeper Life High School following an agreement by all parties to settle the case out of court.  Speaking during the occasion, the lead counsel for Deeper Life High School, Taiwo Kupolati (SAN), commended the State High Court Judge, Justice Ntong, for initiating the peace process.  Speaking with journalists after the novelty match, Deborah Archibong, mother of Don-Davis expressed happiness that all the children involved in the case were alive to witness the reconciliation.
