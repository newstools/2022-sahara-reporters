Human rights activist, Mr Omoyole Sowore, has decried the defection of Former Nigerian President, Dr Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC). Sowore, a presidential aspirant on the platform of the African Action Congress (AAC), described the situation as an age-long denial of the truth by metaphorically relating it to a quote from a German philosopher, Arthur Schopenhauer.  He said in a tweet on Thursday, "Every Lie Has An Expiration Date! @GEJonathan joins Janjaweed APC @OfficialAPCNg.“ME: "All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as being self-evident - Arthur Schopenhauer“#WeCantContinueLike This."
