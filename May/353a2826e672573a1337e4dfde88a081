Former governor of Kano State, Ibrahim Shekarau, may dump the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) following the victory of the Governor Abdullahi Ganduje’s faction at the Supreme Court, SaharaReporters has learnt. It was further gathered that Shekarau and his numerous supporters were also angered by Governor Ganduje's decision to endorse the current deputy governor as the party’s governorship candidate for 2023. Ibrahim Shekarau Accordingly, Shekarau, the leader of the G7 faction that went to court on the party’s state chapter leadership tussle, had summoned a meeting of his top political associates and consultation team, known as the “Shura Council.” A source, close to the former governor and now a senator, revealed, "We've had several meetings following the Supreme Court verdict. "The recent meeting was consequent upon high level consultations the former governor was doing with associates and political friends across the country. And the outcome would soon be made public", he added. Already, some aggrieved members of the APC party have been romancing with the New Nigeria People's Party (NNPP), according to a source close to the National Leader of the NNPP, Rabiu Kwankwaso, in Abuja. Shekarau is reportedly uncomfortable with the APC party's reconciliation moves, "doubting if he would get automatic ticket for the senate as agreed by the party’s national leadership", one of his aides said. However, his spokesperson, Sule Ya’u Sule, said Shekarau had not defected from APC yet. "Consultation is ongoing; the outcome would be communicated to the public", Sule simply said.
