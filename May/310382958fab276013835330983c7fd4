The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) on Friday urged President Muhammadu Buhari to grant a state pardon to the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. Rev. Fr. Ibrahim Nwali made the appeal in Abakaliki, Enugu State, while speaking on behalf of CAN members, in a town hall meeting with the president, who was on a two-day state visit to Ebonyi State.  Nwali said, “Your Excellency, as a father of our dear nation and South-East, we bring to your notice that the sit-at-home order has crippled the economy of the region and banditry is engulfing the nation. “As a body that is of genuine counsel, our country is currently challenged greatly by insecurity and societal conflict here and there with high levels of poverty. A great number of our families are living in fear of the unknown. “We know that you’re doing your best to solve these problems, but we request your Excellency for more dialogue with all nationalists and more empowerment to the various security agencies to tackle this monster called insecurity. “We plead with you for a political solution as a father, a loving father; a forgiving father to grant Nnamdi Kanu freedom.” Buhari, however, in response to the free Nnamdi Kanu request, noted that the case, which is currently before the court, should go through the judicial process.
