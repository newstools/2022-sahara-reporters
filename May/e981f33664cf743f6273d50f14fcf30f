The Anambra State Police Command, on Monday, said its operatives neutralised two gunmen enforcing the sit-at-home order in the state. The police said the gunmen were suspected to be members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), who were allegedly seen along Umunze road in the Orumba South Local Government Area of the state.  The Command's spokesman, DSP Ikenga Tochukwu, who confirmed the killing of the gunmen in a statement issued in Awka, the state capital, alleged that the victims were obstructing the movement of road users going for their businesses. He said, “The Anambra State Command operatives on crime prevention patrol in the early hours of today, 16/5/2022 along Umunze, road, Orumba South LGA, engage arms-bearing gunmen allegedly enforcing sit-at-home in Anambra State. "The operatives neutralised two of the miscreants and recovered a white Toyota Hiace Bus with no registration number. Further details show that these miscreants were obstructing the movement of innocent road users going for their businesses. The hoodlums forcefully collected their motorbikes and tricycles, chased away the passengers and then set the motorcycles or tricycles ablaze. "Meanwhile, the command operatives have intensified patrol within the state and the situation is being monitored. Further details shall be communicated please.” Earlier today, the Ogidi District Office of the Enugu Electricity Distribution Plc and Idemili North Local Government Headquarters with a Magistrate Court were razed by unidentified hoodlums. Also a yet-to-be-identified policeman was reportedly killed on Sunday evening in Eke Oko, Aguata LGA of the state.
