Pro-Biafra group, the Biafra Nations League (BNL) has warned the Cross River State Police Command to release its members who have been wrongfully detained.Recall that on Sunday, the police announced the arrest of 23 members of the Mass Movement for the Actualisation for Biafra (MASSOB). According to the police, some of the suspected MASSOB members were arrested at a watch repairer’s workshop in the Ikom Local Government Area of the state while others were picked from their homes located within and around the town.Reacting, the Biafra Nations League, BnL, said about 17 of the arrested men were its members and not MASSOB members as alleged.The National Leader of BnL, Princewill Richards, said its members were not involved in any crime in the state, warning that the arrest of its Ejagham supporters may cause problems at the border town if not handled with care.Wives of six of the arrested persons said they had not been allowed access to their husbands since last Thursday when the arrest took place.According to Beatrice Ikechukwu Ani, she said her husband and the other men have been without food since their arrest.“Here with me are the wives of Nnamdi Okafor, John Ibe, Ebere Chukwu, Celestine Ndibe, Emmanuel Nachi and we calling on the police to release our husbands immediately,” she said.She said their husbands were at a watch repairing workshop when the police came and took them to the Ikom police station and from there to Calabar.“When they were at Ikom they did not allow us to see or take food to them and from there they brought them to anti cultism unit not even State CID for detention.”Beatrice said their husbands were not cultists or criminals; hence detaining them among cultists and criminals without food was unjust.“The police took them to their houses to search and did not find anything incriminating but insisted on detaining them,”Ani added.
