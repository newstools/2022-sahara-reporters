Former Vice President and presidential aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, on Friday said the Peoples Democratic Party in Lagos State has been in disunity for many years and is reason why the party could not win the state.He also accused the ruling party, All Progressives Congress, APC of causing disunity and woes for the country. Atiku who asserted that Nigeria was more divided under the APC government than pre-civil war era, made this known while speaking in Lagos State at a meeting of PDP members ahead of the upcoming primary election.He said, “We are living witnesses of the challenges that the All Progressives Congress (APC) has caused us in this country.“The biggest challenge that APC has brought is disunity. We have not been as divided like this before even the (civil) war.“We have a responsibility to send the party away but we must be united to enable us to do that. Lagos PDP has been in disunity for many years. I appeal to Lagos PDP to bring about unity in the party. I appeal to the eldest to please ensure unity in the Lagos State chapter of the party so that we can take over the state.“I look forward to working with you to reposition Lagos State PDP. We don’t want Lagos to be under one family. We want Lagos to belong to Lagosians. We should avoid making the same mistake that we have made over the years. I will continue to work with you until we achieve success.”
