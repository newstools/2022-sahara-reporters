An Upper Area Court sitting in Zuba in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja has vacated the arrest order on popular ‘Kayamata’ (aphrodisiac) merchant, Hauwa Muhammed, aka Jaruma.The presiding judge, Ismail Abdullahi while ruling on the application for restoration of her bail filed by her lawyer, Odiba James, vacated the arrest order made on February 23, 2023, following her failure to appear in court for trial lately.  At the resumed hearing of the case on Wednesday, Jaruma's lawyer pleaded with the court over the failure of his client to show up in court as expected, saying it was because of her ill health. He said Jaruma took ill shortly after she was granted bail and could not make it to the court as scheduled. He assured the court that his client would not jump bail and would be of good behaviour.James promised to do everything possible to ensure that the defendant is in court henceforth.He, therefore, prayed the court to grant his prayers as contained in the application seeking the restoration of her bail.The prosecution counsel, Inegbe while raising objection to the application by the defence counsel, described granting the application as a sacrilege to the sanctity of the court.He said the defendant had violated all the orders of the court made in respect of the case, particularly for making public comments on her social media handles.He, therefore, urged the court to deny the application.The judge thereafter stood down the matter for three hours for ruling after he had listened to the submission of both the prosecution and defence counsel.The judge held that in the interest of justice, there should be no hindrance to the substantive suit and bail should not be denied to punish the defendant since she has presented herself in court.The judge said, "In the interest of justice, it is the court’s opinion that there should be no hindrance to the substantive matter. It is a time that bail should not be denied to punish the defendant since she has presented herself."The court might temper justice with mercy. The earlier order of arrest is hereby vacated. But the order for the social media that she should not make any publication and for her not to disrespect the court order is restored.”The court also ordered that Jaruma should submit her passport to the court registry on the condition that if she would not jump bail and is of good behaviour in the two subsequent adjournments, then the passport would be returned to her.The court also told her to respect the adjournment of the case and make herself available for the trial.The judge, therefore, adjourned the case to June 23, 2022, for a hearing.Jaruma was admitted to bail on January 28, 2022, with a civil servant on grade level 12 working within the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) required as surety. The court also cautioned the parties in the case to maintain decorum and avoid making public comments on social media platforms that would be prejudiced in the case.Jaruma was arrested on January 21, 2022, following a petition by a former member of the House of Representatives, Ned Nwoko, after she alleged that one of his wives, Regina, used her products to ‘grab’ (charm) Nwoko, a claim the latter refuted.
