The Ansaru terrorists’ group, a splinter of the dreaded Boko Haram terrorists, has commenced recruitment across communities in the Birnin-Gwari Local government Area of Kaduna State. According to DAILY POST, members of the Ansaru group, in their bid to lure residents, mostly young people into their deadly group, decided to provide Sallah gifts to residents of communities in Birnin-Gwari.

The insurgents, believed to have been operating for years, along the Birnin-Gwari axis, are responsible for many deadly attacks in Kaduna and its environs. A resident of one of the communities in Birnin-Gwari, Alhaji Usman Dankabo said that members of the Ansaru group visited the following villages: Damari, Farin Ruwa, Kwasa Kwasa, Kuyello, Gobirawa, Tabanni, Kutemeshi and Kazage, persuading members of the communities to join them. “They distributed gifts, preached to them, and assured them of safety against any attack,” he said. A resident of one of the villages, Abdullahi Madaki said they distributed biscuits, performed motorcycle stunts to the delight of villagers and distributed pamphlets, flash disks and other accessories to inform people about the activities of the group. Abdullahi said the terrorists vowed to protect them against any invasion and unjust maltreatment. The group had a violent clash with bandits in October 2021, which claimed the lives of over 30 bandits operating around the Damari axis, Birnin-Gwari LGA. Suspected members of the group also last year attacked a military formation along the Kaduna-Birnin-Gwari highway, killing 11 soldiers and four villagers, and injuring many others. They reportedly claimed responsibility for the bombing of two Armoured Personnel Carriers (APC), attached to the security personnel. They were also said to be responsible for the attack on the Kaduna-Abuja train that claimed the lives of eight persons and wounded 26 others. Scores of passengers were also abducted.
