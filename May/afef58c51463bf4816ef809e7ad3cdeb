Adam Namadi, a son of former Vice President, Namadi Sambo, has requested delegates to refund the N2million each he gave them after he failed to secure the ticket for the Kaduna North Federal Constituency of the House of Representatives.He had intended to run under the platform of the opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Namadi, who had promised to add N1.5million to the amount given to each of the delegates if given the ticket, was said to be the aspirant that secured the least votes among the three contenders, Daily Trust reports.The delegates raked in millions of naira from the aspirants who appeared in a hurry to outspend one another.A serving federal lawmaker, Samaila Suleiman, secured the ticket as he defeated Namadi and Shehu Usman ABG.Suleiman, who recently defected from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to the PDP, won with 22 votes against Shehu Usman, who polled 14 votes.According to some delegates who spoke with Daily Trust, Suleiman had distributed between N3.5m and N4m to each delegate while ABG gave out N2.5million in cash and Namadi had distributed N2million to delegates.However, having lost the contest, both ABG and Namadi demanded an immediate refund of the money.Suleiman, who is the Chairman of the House Committee on Special Duties, left the APC following the interest of Governor Nasir el-Rufai’s eldest son in his seat in the green chambers.
