 Human rights activist, Deji Adeyanju has asked Nigerians to blame Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu if the North retains power in 2023.Both Osinbajo and Tinubu are jostling to get the presidential ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Since 1999, Tinubu and Osinbajo have enjoyed a cordial political relationship. The latter served as the attorney-general of Lagos from 1999 to 2007 when the former was the governor of the state.It is widely believed in some quarters that Tinubu nominated Osinbajo as President Muhammadu Buhari’s running mate in 2015 as part of the political bargaining that led to the formation of APC.  Blame these 2 power hungry people for power staying in the North. They started this idea of everyone from anywhere can run for president when we all know power should go to the South East. Also blame the Yoruba people supporting them when their son is just finishing 8yrs as VP. pic.twitter.com/IfCJbWuo10   President Buhari should endorse someone in APC from the South-East to unite the country and rally the country behind that person. He will unite Nigeria with such an action. After 8yrs in office, it will be unconscionable for Buhari to endorse a fellow Northerner. Equity!!!   I hear many people in both APC and PDP have being celebrating since yesterday that power is back to the North after the Atiku victory. Tinubu, Osinbajo and the Yoruba people who refused to unite with Southern Nigeria, hope you are all happy now?   I can never understand why people will just be selfish & not put the interest of others into consideration. Did we even need to be preaching equity to South West? I kept warning from the beginning but they were insulting me non-stop; especially the Yoruba people supporting tribalism. Let it be on record that I warned and I support Igbo Presidency.
