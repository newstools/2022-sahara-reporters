But we don’t know what happened, they later shot the other person they went with. It was some women who were going to the farm early this morning that saw his corpse and raised the alarm.“They later attacked Limi village and killed one person there before leaving. We don’t know what exactly their mission was because they didn’t burn any house and they didn’t kidnap people except those two whom they later killed. One person was left with gunshot injuries and is being treated in the hospital. All the people killed were buried this morning in accordance with Islamic rites.”However, the reason behind the attack has not been revealed as of the time of filing this report.
