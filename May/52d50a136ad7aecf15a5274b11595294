The Nigerian Army said on Saturday that its troops killed two wanted criminals and dislodged an alleged training camp of the Eastern Security Network (ESN) at Okporo community in Orlu Local Government Area of Imo State. A statement by the Director Army Public Relations, Brig Gen Onyema Nwachukwu, said the operation was carried out on Friday, May 20, by troops of 34 Brigade in conjunction with operatives of the Department of State Service.  The statement partly read, “The troops dislodged the training camp after exchanging fire with the dissidents, neutralising two notorious members of the group, who have been on the wanted list of security agencies and have been terrorising residents in the general area of Orlu, Orsu and Njaba. "The troops equally destroyed the training shed and other facilities used by the separatists, including a shrine, which members of the outlawed group reportedly use for spiritual fortification. A local factory for fabricating weapons was also discovered and destroyed. "A search of the factory uncovered three dane guns, one locally fabricated pistol, one live round of 7.62mm, one live cartridge, two used shells of 7.62mm (special) and objects suspected to be charms, among other dangerous weapons."
