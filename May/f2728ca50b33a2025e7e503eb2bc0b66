Governor Aminu Tambuwal has imposed a curfew in Sokoto State to curb further spread of violence going by Muslim protesters, mainly youths, demanding the release of two suspected killers of a female student of the Shehu Shagari College of Education, Deborah Samuel.The suspects were earlier arrested and detained by the police. The governor said the directive was issued “in pursuance of peace and order in Sokoto metropolis and the entire state.”Violent outbreaks have been reported across Sokoto on Saturday amidst protests for the release of those responsible for Thursday’s killing of Deborah.Deborah, a 200-level home economics student, was killed at about 9am for allegedly criticising Prophet Muhammad. Her killing has sparked nationwide outrage, with political and religious leaders demanding urgent arrest and prosecution of all suspects.SaharaReporters earlier today reported that residents of Sokoto State, mainly youths, in their numbers on Saturday stormed the Sultan of Sokoto’s palace, setting up a bonfire near the building and demanding the release of the two suspects.But armed policemen had fired teargas canisters to disperse the angry crowd, during which two persons were reportedly injured.A source who spoke to SaharaReporters had said the protesters became violent and started hurling objects at the police.He had said, “They are protesting against the statement issued by the Sultanate Council of Islamic Affairs (Sultan of Sokoto) condemning the killing of Deborah and the arrest of two persons believed to have participated in the killing.” The protesters who were speaking in Hausa language in a video obtained by SaharaReporters said Deborah committed a serious offence for insulting Prophet Muhammad (SAW).
