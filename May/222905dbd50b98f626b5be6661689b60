The Chairman of the Ikwo Local Government Area of Ebonyi State, Elder Steve Orogwu, on Tuesday evening escaped death by the whiskers when unknown gunmen invaded his country home and killed three of his brothers.SaharaReporters reliably gathered that the hoodlums had stormed the Chairman’s home in Ekpaomaka late Tuesday night but they didn’t meet him at home. Angered, the invading hoodlums turned their guns on his brothers and shot three dead with their neighbours whose identities were not yet clear as of the time of this report.It was learnt that the corpses of the victims were taken to a mortuary in Abakaliki yesterday.The Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, had through its spokesperson, Emma Powerful, announced Wednesday, May 18, and also May 26 as sit-at-home, but a faction of the group said it announced a three-day sit-at-home that began with the Monday’s sit-at-home.It was gathered that the Tuesday’s sit-at-home was not successful in Abakaliki as movements were noticed.A heavy police presence and that of other security agents helped maintain normalcy, but the gunmen were believed to have assaulted other areas with less security.Efforts to get the reaction of the police in Ebonyi were unsuccessful as the Command's spokesperson, Loveth Odah, didn't take her calls or respond to text messages as of the time of filling the report.
