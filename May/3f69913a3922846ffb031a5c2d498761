There is uncertainty around the Peoples Democratic Party's (PDP) presidential primary billed to hold today, Saturday in Abuja, as journalists and other stakeholders were still waiting for accreditation as of 8am. The National Organising committee for the 2022 presidential primaries had said accreditation for the convention would start by 6am on Saturday. But at about 8am on Saturday, journalists and other stakeholders who besieged the party headquarters at Wuse Zone Five were still waiting for accreditation, Daily Trust reports. The National Working Committee (NWC) of the party were said to be locked in a meeting at the time of writing this report. There are unconfirmed reports that going by the extension of deadline for primaries given by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) late on Friday, the PDP may shift its presidential primary. The ruling All Progressives Congress already postponed its presidential primary to June 6. The officials on the ground at the PDP secretariat have refused to speak on the real situation of things.
