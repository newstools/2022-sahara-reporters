Operatives of the Lagos State Police Command on Tuesday arraigned four teachers of Chrisland Schools at the Magistrate Court sitting in the Yaba area of the state. The teachers arraigned were those who accompanied some pupils of the school to the World School Games in Dubai. The students had been involved in a viral pornographic video.  Some weeks ago, the alleged sex video of some students of the school surfaced online. The mother of the female pupil involved had come online to seek the help of Nigerians as she alleged that her daughter was drugged by the male students and forced to engage in the sexual act. She further alleged that the school conducted a pregnancy test on her daughter without her (the mother's) consent. However, in a statement released by Akin Fadeyi, a member of the Advisory board of the school, the school authorities denied claims that it conducted a pregnancy test on the girl. According to the school, only a COVID-19 test was conducted on all the students who embarked on the trip to Dubai. Recall that on April 20, the Lagos State Police Command invited all the pupils of Chrisland Schools, Lagos, involved in the viral child pornographic video, for questioning.
