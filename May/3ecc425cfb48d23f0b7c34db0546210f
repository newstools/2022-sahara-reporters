Canada-based Nigerian woman, Stephanie Otobo, who had some years ago alleged that she had an amorous relationship with Apostle Johnson Suleman, the General Overseer of Omega Fire Ministries, has released nude photos of the clergyman in a Twitter thread. Otobo, who took to her Twitter handle on Monday, shared screenshots of her video chat with Suleman asking him to come forward and debunk her claims.  A photo of the clergyman holding his penis was shared and another showing her breasts while on a video call with him was also shared online. She alleged that the cleric tried everything to stop her from progressing, and had almost ended her life. She wrote on Twitter, “If these screenshots were fake, how did I get his pics that aren't public in the first place and how come I'm the first to release this kind of pics of him? He has changed his hairstyle twice since I came out to speak up with receipts. He has done a lot to appear different.
