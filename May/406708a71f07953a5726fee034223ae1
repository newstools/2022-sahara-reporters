The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), has imposed a 150,000 Swiss Franc (N 63,931,249.48) fine on Nigeria. Some aggrieved Nigerian fans had vandalised the football pitch after Nigeria’s senior male football team, Super Eagles drew 1-1 with their Ghanaian counterparts, the Black Stars, in a match that was to decide who would qualify for the tournament.  The Super Eagles lost the ticket to Black Stars of Ghana following the 1-1 draw on March 29 at the MKO National Stadium Abuja with the visitors going through on away-goal rule. But in a dispatch by FIFA, the body’s Disciplinary Committee decried the poor organisation of the match for lack of order and security at the match, adding there was ‘failure to implement existing safety rules and failure to ensure that law and order are maintained in the stadium, invasion of the field of play and throwing of objects’.
