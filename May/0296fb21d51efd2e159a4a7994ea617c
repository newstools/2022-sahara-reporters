The looming crisis in the National Working Committee (NWC) of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) took another dimension on Tuesday as two National Vice Chairmen of the party accused the National Chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, of rendering the body functionless. This was disclosed in a joint statement they issued, titled: “APC and the need for vigilance: urgent call for intervention.”  The statement was signed by the National Vice Chairman, North West, Salihu Mohd Lukman and National Vice Chairman, South West, Isaac Kekemeke, claiming that all was not well with the two-month-old committee, Nation reports. The two APC chieftains urged the party stakeholders to call the National Chairman to order before his actions would damage the party completely. The Vice-Chairmen accused the National Chairman of usurpation of other executives' functions. They said he was guilty of unilaterally taking decisions without consultation and approval of the committee as required by the party’s constitution.
