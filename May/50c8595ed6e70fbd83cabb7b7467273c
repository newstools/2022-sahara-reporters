Apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo has criticised the unknown gunmen enforcing a sit-at-home order in the South-East region on Mondays. President-General of the group, George Obiozor, while addressing the Ohanaeze’s Ameobi, the highest decision-making organ of the body on Thursday, described the sit-at-home order as a slur to the region. Ohanaeze Ndigbo According to Obiozor, businessmen in the region have already incurred multiple losses due to the sit-at-home order. He also lamented the spate of insecurity across the South-East. He said: “The Monday sit-at-home is a slur on the Igbo. It is strange for a group to face the barrel of the gun inwards. Many people have estimated the huge loss the South-East incurs on a weekly basis as a result of the sit-at-home order. “Ohanaeze Ndigbo has tried several times to persuade our youths to realise the consequences of their actions. “Insecurity has pervaded almost all parts of Nigeria, but each geo-political zone has its own peculiarity. “The advent of insecurity in the South-East is both bizarre and dramatic. The South-East had been adjudged the most serene and peaceful zone in Nigeria until April 5, 2021, when gunmen attacked the Correctional Facility in Owerri, Imo State and freed a total of 1,844 prison inmates. “Since the April 5 episode, insecurity in the South-East has attained an unprecedented unbearable crescendo.”
