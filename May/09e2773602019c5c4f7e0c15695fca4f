He reiterated the fact that UmuChineke must remain vigilant now than ever, and he advised everyone to be conscious of their engagements. He was very emphatic on being focused and never to derail.“As usual, Onyendu expresses his profound gratitude to you all, UmuChineke for remaining strong in your solidarity, unshaken faith, and seemingly resolute.“Onyendu is particularly enthused about the peaceful conduct of UmuChineke, and consequently, encourages you all to keep it up, and be assured that at the end of the tunnel, there must be light. Details of our other engagement with ONYENDU may not be made public because our adversaries are all over the place trying to sniff for information on our strategies, but we cannot avail them.“May we remind UmuChineke, that your prayers are most compelling now, such devotion is not taken for granted. The next Court date is the 18th of May, 2022, keep it in your prayers and in your mind.”
