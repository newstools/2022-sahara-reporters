One for Shira/Giade federal constituency under PDP and the other won the senatorial ticket for Bauchi North under APC,” a resident told SaharaReporters.“We the residents and the world entirely need to know why such unpopular candidates were imposed on the people; was it because their father is the CJN?"Another source revealed, “They distributed over 150 vehicles; what jobs are they doing to have money to buy such expensive cars? And same CJN do sit on corruption cases whereas his sons are spending anyhow without known sources of income.“These guys spent billions before the primaries, sharing cars and doing empowerments. They also used their father's office to give out jobs to party members.”
