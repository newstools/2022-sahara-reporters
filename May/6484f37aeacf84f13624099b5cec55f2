A video of a Nigerian policeman supporting the lynching of Deborah Samuel, a female student of the Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto State, by her colleagues over alleged blasphemy has been obtained by SaharaReporters. According to the yet-to-be-named officer, those who are not in support of the action of the mobs are Kafiri (unbelievers).  “Anyone insulting the prophet should be killed and anyone questioning about that is a Kuffar (unbeliever),” he said in Hausa language. SaharaReporters had reported how Deborah was killed and burnt by her colleagues for allegedly insulting Prophet Muhammad (SAW). She had protested the indiscriminate posting of Islamic messages on a school WhatsApp group before the mob took offence and set her up for murder. As widespread outrage continues over the murder, some Northern leaders have expressed approval for the mob that carried out the gruesome killing under the guise of blasphemy.
