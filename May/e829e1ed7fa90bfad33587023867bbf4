Mrs. Harira Jibril (32), an indigene of Adamawa State by birth and married to Jibril Ahmed, was gunned down by “unknown gunmen”, recently, in Anambra State. Her three innocent children, Khadija, (7), Hadiza (5) and Zaituna (2) were also mowed down in this insensate act of terrorism, recklessly perpetrated without any justification whatsoever. The life of the unborn baby that Mrs Jibril carried in her womb at the time of this dastardly act was also cruelly terminated. No reason has been given and none could have been proffered for this criminal act of brutality, extended even to toddlers and the unborn. There should be no hiding place for the barbarians; so Governor Charles Soludo owes the nation the sacred duty to do all in his powers to fish out those who killed Mrs Jubril and her children, in their prime. The concept of national unity will be a mirage if citizens do not feel safe in other locations different from their places of origin. If the primitive and evil motive of this mindless act is to provoke rival ethnic war, I urge the people of Nigeria to resist this by continuously holding government accountable to the discharge of its constitutional responsibilities of guaranteeing the lives and security of the people. My heartfelt condolences go to Mr. Jibril Ahmed, the good people of Adamawa and Anambra States, believing that in no time, the perpetrators will be unveiled and made to face the wrath of the law, no matter their status or motive. A criminal act cannot be justified under any guise at all and the perpetrators must be traced and dealt with according to law, by all means necessary. Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, SANLekki, Lagos.25/05/2022
