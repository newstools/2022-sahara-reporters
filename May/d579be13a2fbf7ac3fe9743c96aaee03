They begged President Muhammadu Buhari, the military chiefs and international organisations to help secure the release, Punch reports.This is the first time the families would be protesting in Abuja since the March 28 incident, which led to the death of no fewer than eight persons; 26 persons injured and several persons were abducted.SaharaReporters had earlier reported that one of the relatives, Jimoh, said it was distasteful to detain minors in whatever situation and appealed to the government to release the eight minors whom the bandits claimed were being held in Adamawa State.
