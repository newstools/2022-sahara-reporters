The primaries for Senate and House of Representatives are now May 24 and 25 respectively.  This was contained in a new timetable for primary elections into various elective positions the party released on Tuesday, through its National Organising Secretary, Suleiman Argungu.The has also fixed Saturday, May 14 for the screening of presidential, governorship, Senate and House of Representatives aspirants while that of the House of Assembly will take place on May 13.In the previous timetable, the primaries for governorship was fixed for May 18, the state House of Assembly for May 20, while the primaries for House of Representatives and Senate were scheduled for May 22 and 24 respectively.Also with the new timetable, the primaries for Senate and House of Representatives are now May 24 and 25 respectively.These changes may not be unconnected to the amendment to section 84(8) of the Electoral Act, which the Senate passed on Tuesday.The current Electoral Act excludes statutory delegates from indirect primaries. If the parties should proceed without the amendment passed, statutory delegates will be exempted from participating in the primaries.Although the Senate has passed the amendment, the House of Representatives is yet to concur.The lower chamber will consider the bill today (Wednesday) and is expected to concur before it will now be transmitted to President Muhammadu Buhari for assent.These adjustments are coming amidst call for the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to extend the deadline for the conclusion of all primaries.The country’s 18 registered political parties, through the Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC), on Tuesday, asked the commission to review its timetable and schedule of activities to afford member parties enough time to put their houses in order.The electoral body has insisted on June 3 as the deadline for party primaries.
