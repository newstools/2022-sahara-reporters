A House of Representatives aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr. Philip Okwuada on Monday fainted after losing the party’s primaries in Delta State.  It was learnt that Okwuada was bidding to represent Ika Federal constituency in the Green chamber of the National Assembly.  In a video credited to Flag News, seen by SaharaReporters, Okwuada slumps while observing a live interview shortly after the exercise.  Okwuada was beaten in the primary election by Victor Nwokolo, who had 75 votes. Meanwhile, Okwuada only managed 7 votes.  However, efforts made by SaharaReporters to know Okwuada’s current health status were not successful.  Okwuada’s support group on Facebook named Dr Philip Okwuada Support Group says, “This group is to beckon on the well meaning sons and daughters of IKA to show support and solidarity to man of enviable character, a man of excellence in transparency, a man of the people for the people. A man you can count on for proper representation.”
