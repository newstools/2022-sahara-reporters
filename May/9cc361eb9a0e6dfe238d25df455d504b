Students of Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ago-Iwoye, Ogun State on Friday blocked the Ijebu Ode-Ibadan Expressway during a peaceful protest tagged #EndASUUStrike, preventing human and vehicular movements on the road.The students urged the Nigerian Government to resolve the impasse with their striking lecturers in order to return to class. The angry students in their number barricaded the road to protest against the protracted industrial action embarked upon by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) across the country.The ongoing strike has lasted about three months and there is no sign that it will end soon.The peaceful protest caused gridlock along the road as motorists and passengers were stranded.The students vowed not to open the road until their demands are met.The Chairman, Fund Education Coalition, Damilare Adenola, who address the students, said they would not give up on the "national action' just as being pushed by the students, to sustain the tempo of protests across the country. Also, the Public Relations Officer of the Coalition, Joseph Aliu who addressed the protesters said, “It is saddening that after a series of talks, the Federal Government has failed to listen to the voice of reasoning.“Since they’ve chosen to turn a deaf ear to the cries of the striking lecturers, we have no other option but to take to the streets. We are here, we’re not stopping, here’s a fight to the finish. We are not going back."On his part, the President of the Students Union Government of the school, Akorede Afeez, said, "It is an impediment to the societal growth and development of this nation in general that the students have been in their houses since 14th February 2022. "The state government should rise up to their responsibility and take charge of the education welfare of OOU. "We demand the reopening of our classes. Education is our right, not a privilege. "We say no to technology fees and exorbitant school fees.”
