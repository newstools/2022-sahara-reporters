Peter Obi, former governor and one of the top Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential aspirants, may dump the party should he fail to get the presidential ticket, a source close to the aspirant told SaharaReporters on Wednesday.The PDP has fixed May 28 and May 29 for its presidential primary. The party has also cleared 15 aspirants to compete for the presidential ticket with Obi; former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar; former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki; Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal and the Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State are some of the leading aspirants.The source close to Obi said the former governor was under pressure to dump the PDP and pursue his presidential bid in another political party.The source added that though other aspirants from the South-East had accepted to work for him, his chances of getting the ticket was low.“The results of various primaries of the party conducted so far have showed those most of these delegates are loyal to,” the source said.“So he (Obi) is under pressure to leave the PDP for the moneybags, we are currently looking to find another party to accept him. Don’t be surprised that Obi will be the third force Nigerians have been waiting for.”
