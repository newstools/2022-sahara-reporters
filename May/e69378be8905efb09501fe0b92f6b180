Some executives of the Enugu State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) may soon be charged for forgery of PDP receipts and three-man Ad-hoc delegates forms, SaharaReporters has learnt.The affected executives include the Chairman of the Enugu State chapter of the PDP, Chief Augustine Nnamani; Secretary, Mr. Cletus Akalusi and Chief of Staff to Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, Dr. Festus Uzoh. The men ran into trouble following an alleged attempt to mislead the court in their bid to prove that they followed the PDP Constitution and Guidelines for the Election of Three-Man Delegates and National Delegates in the election of 780 ad-hoc delegates on April 30, 2022, Ward Congress across the 260 wards of the state.Controversy has trailed the April 30 exercise in Enugu following the allegation that while a section of Enugu PDP leaders followed the party’s guidelines, Governor Ugwuanyi and the leadership of the party in the state handed a list of ad-hoc delegates allegedly generated four days to the real exercise to the Prince Vincent Yandev Amaabai-led PDP national.  SaharaReporters’ investigation had earlier reported that the party did not make result sheets available in any of the 260 wards in the state. The Enugu State PDP, coordinated by Chief Augustine Nnamani, Dr. Festus Uzoh, and others had quickly put together some members of the party loyal to the governor to institute a case in the Enugu State High Court, seeking to have their list upheld as the authentic ad-hoc delegates list.Consequent upon the lawsuit marked E/379/2022, which has PDP; PDP National Chairman, Senator Iyorchia Ayu; PDP National Secretary, Senator Samuel Anyanwu; PDP National Organising Secretary, Hon. Bature Mohammed; Chairman, Enugu State Chapter of the PDP, Chief Augustine Nnmani; among others as Defendants, the Plaintiffs, namely Prince Paul Nnaji & Ors also got an ex-parte order from Justice Harold Eya’s court restraining the Defendants from recognising or giving effect to any other three-man ad-hoc delegates list other than the list that emerged from the congress held on April 30, 2022, pending the hearing of the Motion on Notice.Meanwhile, the Plaintiffs, in the bid to prove that only those on the list in question purchased nomination forms and therefore validly stood for the three-man delegates’ election, showed receipts for the nomination forms to prove their case.However, it was discovered that whereas the PDP Guidelines duly signed by the National Chairman and National Secretary pegged the cost ward ad-hoc delegates forms at N5,000, the purported official receipts exhibited as Exhibit “E” bearing Prince Paul Nnaji, Exhibit “F” bearing Onu Tobias Ogbonna, and Exhibit “H” bearing Agbo Kelvin Ikechukwu bears N50,000 each.Ironically, contrary to the claim that Senator Ike Ekweremadu’s supporters who participated in the exercise and had also applied and were joined in the suit did not purchase nomination forms as stipulated by PDP Guidelines, their lawyers exhibited authentic receipt of payment of N5,000 for each form.“This is a major setback for the governor’s camp because you cannot put something on nothing and expect it to stand. It means that the so-called three-man delegates list they have been parading is fake and fraudulent. So, SaharaReporters were impeccable in their previous investigative report on how Ugwuanyi compiled a fraudulent delegates list.“Besides, all those involved in the clear forgery are in trouble because I can reliably inform you that they will be charged for forgery. In fact, there is palpable fear now as arrests may be made today (Friday),” an insider source revealed.
