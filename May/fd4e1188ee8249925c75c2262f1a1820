The United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, has arrived in Nigeria on a two-day official visit, his first visit to Nigeria since his appointment.  The United Nations information centre in Nigeria said Guterres is expected to meet with Borno State governor, Babagana Zulum in Maiduguri, the state capital.  He is also expected to embark on a field mission where he will meet with families affected by terrorism.  Boko Haram and ISWAP terrorists have been wreaking havoc in Nigeria, particularly in the Northeastern states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa. The terrorism war has gone on for over 12 years during which hundreds of thousands of people have been killed or kidnapped and many more displaced.    Guterres, who has proceeded to Borno, is also expected to evaluate the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities and assess progress made as well as the challenges to the COVID-19 recovery.  He is also scheduled to visit Abuja to meet with President Muhammadu Buhari, Vice-President Yemi Osibanjo and other top cabinet officials.    Before leaving Abuja, Guterres will officiate a wreath-laying ceremony for the victims of the 2011 bombing at the U.N. house.  The 2011 Abuja bombing was a car bomb explosion on Friday, August 26, 2011, Abuja's UN building that killed 23 UN employees and wounded 60.  Guterres will also meet with Nigerian youths, women, religious leaders, journalists and diplomatic communities.
