The Chief Imam of the Muslims Foundation Mosque, who is also the Zamfara State Commissioner for Religious Affairs, Sheikh Sani Tukur Jangebe, has denounced the gruesome murder of Deborah Samuel, a female student of the Sokoto State College of Education.The Imam stated this while delivering his Friday sermon in Gusau where he urged Muslims to abide by the teachings and lessons of Islam, Daily Post reports. Jangebe noted that even the Prophet Mohammed (SAW) received several insults and humiliations during his life but he did not order the killing of his adversaries.He explained that it was sinful for any Muslim to take such laws into his or her hands, saying that Allah did not authorise such ruling in Islam.Zamfara is a Sharia-inclined state – a structure which dates back to former Governor Sani Yerima’s administration which brought the state under Sharia laws.SaharaReporters had earlier reported that Deborah Samuel, a 200-level student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto, was killed on Thursday over alleged blasphemy.
