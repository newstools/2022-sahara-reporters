The Nigerian Air Force has postponed its 2022 celebration billed to hold in Kano State, after it was learnt that there was a suspected bomb explosion.The event initially scheduled for Thursday has now been moved to Saturday. NAF’s spokesman, Edward Gabkwet, who announced this in a terse statement issued in Abuja did not give reason for the postponement, but a senior officer of the force cited the explosion in Kano.The official said, ”With the recent explosion in Sabon Gari in Kano, the venue of our 2022 celebration, we need to refortify and strengthen the security of the area before we commence the programme to avoid any unwarranted circumstances.”SaharaReporters had earlier today reported that an early morning explosion at Aba Road, Sabon Gari, threw the residents into confusion.The incident was said to have occurred at a private school identified as Fimbal Royal Schools, with a yet-to-be-ascertained number of people feared killed while scores were injured.Details of the blast are still sketchy as there were claims the explosion was as a result of suicide bombing. Others claimed it was caused by cooking gas.Gory images and videos of victims have flooded the microblogging platform, Twitter.The National Emergency Management Agency had yet to make an official statement.However, announcing the postponement of the NAF event, Gabkwet said it was due to “unforeseen circumstances.”He said, ”The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Day 2022 Celebration earlier scheduled to take place from 19-21 May 2022 at NAF Base, Kano has now been rescheduled to take place from 21- 23 May 2022 at the same venue.”This was due to unforeseen circumstances. The NAF wishes to apologise to all its invited guests for the inconveniences the new shift in date may have caused them.”
