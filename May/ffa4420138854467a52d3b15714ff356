The trial of Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, on Wednesday, resumed at the Federal High Court in Abuja.However, unlike previous trials, Daily Post reports that the court authorities dismissed some of the stringent conditions surrounding Kanu's trial. Also, journalists and other media practitioners were granted access to the courtroom after proper identification.Also, lawyers and litigants are allowed to witness the treasonable felony charges brought against the Biafra nation agitator by the Federal Government.Regardless of this, there is a heavy security presence at the court as operatives of the Department of State Services, DSS, have taken perfect control of the security situations within and outside the court premises.The court had last month issued a Practice Direction which moved the trial to CCT believed to be large and spacious enough to accommodate the crowd that usually surged to witness the trial.The Practice Direction endorsed by the Chief Judge of the Court, Justice John Tsoho had also prohibited media coverage except where expressly permitted.However, the court has jettisoned the stringent conditions hitherto attached to the trial.Although, reasons for deviating from the Practice Direction have not been made known, it was gathered that Jabi Code of Conduct Tribunal was considered too porous for such a sensitive trial, especially from the security points.Apart from unhindered access being granted to lawyers and media practitioners, roads leading to the court are not blocked, while food vendors are also having their businesses done without molestation.
