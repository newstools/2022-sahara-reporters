A pro-Biafra separatist group, Biafra Nations League (BnL) has accused the Nigeria Police Force of trying to execute its members arrested in Ikom, Cross River State, a few days ago. Deputy leader of BnL, Ebuta Takon said the police tried to secretly execute the Ejagham supporters "if not for online bloggers who first published the information".  Takon, an Ejagham, accused the police of starving his people in detention while rejecting any form of visitation.He warned that the situation in Bakassi and the South-East would be worse compared to what will happen if they are detained for long without trial. He said the Ejagham people across the Southeastern end will align with their Ejagham brothers in Southern Cameroon to ensure that there is no peace around the borders which are inhabited by the Ejagham in Nigeria and Cameroon. "They know what Ejagham people are capable of doing, as inhabitants of major hinterland border towns, and members of two countries (Nigeria and Cameroon), we are capable of terminating business activities around our borders. This action might lead to what they don't expect. “They should not play with our people because we don't bark but bite," Takon said. Members of the group in Ikom had during the coronavirus lockdown flouted the Covid-19 rules by mobilising themselves to hoist the Biafran flag on the main border road, accusing the government of allowing Fulani people to be entering state borders to attack people despite the lockdown. The group had in October 2021 ordered the shutdown of borders between Nigeria and Southern Cameroon, in solidarity with the trial of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu. The group in a statement by its National Leader, Princewill Richard, had said that the closure would be between October 19 and 22.
