Former President, Goodluck Jonathan, who was elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), was conspicuously absent on Saturday as the party members gathered at the Moshood Abiola Stadium in Abuja to elect its 2023 presidential candidate. Even though his name and picture were on the convention programme, the ex-president was not seen at the venue.

Jonathan was president between 2010 to 2015 before he was defeated by President Muhammadu Buhari of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). But in the last few years, the former president has distanced himself from the various activities of the party. Meanwhile, Jonathan’s absence from the all-important national convention of the PDP confirms SaharaReporters’ stories earlier today that the former president was being prepared by some APC cabals and Buhari’s kitchen cabinet as the APC's 2023 consensus candidate.

“His form has secretly been submitted. He submitted his nomination form through the APC Chairman a few days ago,” a source in the ruling party privy to information had said.“Members of President Muhammadu Buhari’s cabal are still pushing for Jonathan to become the party’s consensus candidate.”Speaking on Saturday, one of the top sources added, “Another option they are considering is that the Supreme Court is expected to rule in favour of Buhari next week on the Electoral Act. That ruling will likely permit the super delegates (earlier excluded) to vote for Jonathan if it boils down to voting in the primaries.” Jonathan was Nigeria’s leader as a member of the PDP, which is now an opposition party.
