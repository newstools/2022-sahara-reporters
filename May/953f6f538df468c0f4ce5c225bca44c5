Gunmen on Sunday afternoon engaged the Nigeria Police Force operatives on an observation patrol along Abatete Expressway, close to Ogidi Town Hall in the Idemili North Local Government Area of Anambra State, killing an officer and escaping with his rifle. A resident of the area in a video clip seen by SaharaReporters, said, “They have killed one policeman. This one is happening at Ogidi Town Hall, Umuru, Ogidi. They took his gun. They stayed here for a long time.”  Meanwhile, while many residents and passersby were still gathering around the lifeless body of the unidentified policeman, a Toyota Sienna car with tinted glass arrived at the location and immediately, everyone scampered for safety, shouting “see these people” while gunshots could be heard immediately. SaharaReporters gathered that the assailants stood at the road for a long time until they sighted one of the policemen, shot him dead and disappeared with his AK-47 rifle. When contacted, the Anambra State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Tochukwu Ikenga, said, “Information before me states that on 29/05/2022 at about 12:50pm, police operatives on Observation Patrol along Abatete expressway, Ogidi engaged some armed hoodlums. “Unfortunately, during the gun duel, one of the police operative was fatally wounded and due to the superior fire of the police, the gunmen fled the scene. “Meanwhile, the operation is still ongoing and patrol has been intensified in the area.
