The Leader of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, has said the former governor of Anambra State and presidential aspirant on the platform of Labour Party, Peter Obi would not win the election in 2023. The cleric advised the former governor of Anambra to leave politics and help indigent Nigerians even though he described him as a fantastic leader.  Obi last week resigned from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and joined the Labour Party, blaming it on “recent developments” within the PDP. Ayodele disclosed this in a statement by his Media Aide, Oluwatosin Osho, saying, “There is no way Peter Obi can contest and win, it’s either he resigns from politics or wastes his money. Better still, he should help Nigerians that are suffering with his resources.  “He was misled into joining the Labour Party to pursue his presidential ambition; he has missed it. Igbos have missed it already, their generations to come will remember this and curse them.  “The South-East political leaders have successfully jeopardised the chances of the Igbos and turned the zone to something else.  “Igbo have no leaders; they don’t like themselves at all. Peter Obi is a fantastic leader, but he cannot become the next president of Nigeria. Any party that gives him ticket will be a waste of time (sic).”
