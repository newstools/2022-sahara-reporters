Former senator and public commentator, Shehu Sani, has lamented the outrageous costs of party nomination forms ahead of the 2023 general elections. The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) had fixed the cost of nomination forms for president at N100million, governorship at N50million, Senate at N20million, House of Representatives at N10million and state assembly at N2million.  The leading opposition party, the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) also pegged N40million as the cost for presidential nomination forms, N21million for governorship, N3.5million for senate, N2.5million for the House of Representatives and N1.5million for the state House of Assembly. While the two main parties introduced concessions for women and a 50% discount for young aspirants, aspirants are still subject to paying other high sundry fees for administrative costs and state secretariat fees before nomination forms are submitted for processing. The development has continued to elicit intense outrage from many Nigerians, who argued such would affect the electoral process and governance negatively. On his Twitter page on Wednesday, Sani, who represented Kaduna Central Senatorial District in the 8th Assembly, said the cost of nomination form would escalate kidnapping for ransom in Nigeria. He wrote, "The outrageous cost of party nomination forms will encourage and escalate kidnappings for ransom in Nigeria."
