The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has released a former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mrs Patricia Olubunmi Etteh, on bail. The EFCC in a statement issued by its spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren, said that the former Speaker was released on Friday night after fulfilling bail conditions offered to her by the investigators working on her case.  Uwujaren said that Etteh would be reporting periodically to the agency as one of the conditions for her release in order to assist the commission with further investigations. SaharaReporters had reported that the former Speaker was arrested on May 17 over suspicious and shady financial involvement with Phil Jin Projects Limited. Reports had it that Phil Jin Projects Limited was granted a contract by the Niger Delta Development Commission for the supply of solar-powered street lights in some communities in Akwa Ibom State. The company received N287million, even though the contract was worth N240m. Phil Jin Project Ltd later allegedly paid N130million to Patricia Etteh. However, the EFCC is investigating to find out why the ex-minister received the money when she was not a director of the company.
