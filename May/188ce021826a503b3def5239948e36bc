The apex Igbo Socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, has condemned the decision of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to throw open its presidential ticket instead of zoning it to the South East. It said that the position of the Southern and Middle Belt Leadership Forum, the Southern Governors Forum and indeed all the “right-thinking patriotic Nigerians” is very clear that "a Northerner must not hand over to a Northerner" if Nigeria must survive.  It said the PDP has a choice to make; nominate a Northerner and fail woefully and be buried with an epitaph "there once existed a treacherous political party which changed its goal post at the middle of the game". Ohanaeze spokesman, Dr Alex Ogbonnia, who spoke exclusively with SaharaReporters on the resolution of PDP to throw open its presidential for 2023 Presidency, said, "It is possible that Sen. Iyorcha Ayu needed to throw the sale of the presidential forms open to fit into the current bourgeois-democratic paradigm." Though the PDP added that consensus is not out in its resolution on the zoning of the presidential ticket, Ogbonnia said, "The Igbo will soon challenge the PDP with our consensus candidate", adding that "this project of a Nigerian President of South-East extraction is a desideratum; no going back, a to be or not to be existentialism." He said, "Be reminded that just as God provided a David with a stone to kill Goliath, that God has not changed. This is a just cause and the David will surely come, how, I don't know, but come, he must. "And to the Igbo that runs after presidential aspirants from other geopolitical zones, I will only add that history is replete with how a betrayer ends."
