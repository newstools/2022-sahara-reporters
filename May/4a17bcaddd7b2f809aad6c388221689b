Delegates of the Peoples Democratic Party PDP in Taraba State on Wednesday stoned the convoy of Governor Darius Ishaku and his Deputy, Haruna Manu at the Catholic Pastoral Centre, Jalingo. It was learnt that the delegates drove the deputy governor away from the venue where the primaries were billed to take place by pelting him with stones.  According to the Daily Post, shortly after the deputy governor was driven away, Governor Ishaku’s convoy arrived at the venue. However, his convoy was also stoned by the delegates who insisted that they were not interested in talking to the governor and the leadership of the party. Some of the delegates said they were unhappy with the imposition of the state PDP party chairman, Kefas Agbu, as the governorship aspirant when he was not part of the process until barely 48 hours before the primaries. Agbu had earlier denied being a part of the governorship race in the state but suddenly joined the race after a former Minister of Defence, General Theophilus Danjuma (retd) allegedly anointed him as his candidate for the party ahead of the 2023 general elections. However, the action has sparked widespread condemnation and agitations from stakeholders who insist that they would not have the elder statesman impose a candidate on the party again, more so that the candidate is the seating chairman of the party. He is also said to come from the same zone as the current governor, who is about to complete his second tenure in office.
