A former Ekiti State Deputy Governor, Prof Kolapo Olusola has withdrawn from the senatorial primary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for Ekiti South.In a letter signed by Olusola and addressed to the National Chairman of the PDP, the former Deputy Governor said he was pressurized by a former Governor of the state, Ayodele Fayose, to join the race. He said he however later found out that after openly endorsing him, Fayose was giving support to someone else.  This was contained in a letter titled ‘Notification of Withdrawal from Senatorial Contest’ and dated May 19, 2022.The letter reads, “I wish to notify the national leadership of our esteemed party of my voluntary withdrawal from participating in the forthcoming Peoples Democratic Party senatorial contest in Ekiti State.“Your Excellency will recall that I contested for the last governorship primary election in which I came third. As a patriotic man who is determined o protect the interest and ethos of the party, I congratulated the winner, Otunba Bisi Kolawole who is currently the candidate of the party.  “It is expedient to note, however, that the senatorial ambition was the making of former Governor Ayodele Fayose. I received emissaries from him to contest. After much pressure from concerned stakeholders, I decided to pick up the challenge to represent the party in my senatorial district.“To my great surprise, Mr. Ayodele Fayose, who openly endorsed my candidacy for Senate in my town, discretely aided another person from the same constituency to pick the same senatorial form.“The above left me with no choice but to consider his endorsement as a façade and decoy.“Having consulted widely on the foregoing with my teeming supporters across the sixteen (16) Local Governments, I have decided not to dwell where there is no sincerity of purpose but an arrogant display of deception and hence pulled out from the contest.“The integrity I have built over the years is beyond my ambition. I am available for further arrangements that will unite the party in the build-up to the general election, slated to hold on 18th June, 2022.”
