Another drama has ensued at the venue of the Enugu State Peoples Democratic Party governorship primary election involving the former governor of Enugu State and Senator representing Enugu East Senatorial zone, Dr Chimaroke Nnamani, who engaged in a brawl with one of the aspirants. In what many described as a show of shame the Senator was captured on camera harassing and in a heated argument with Hon Chijioke Edeoga, former Chairman of the House Committee on Information, House of Representatives.  It took the swift intervention of the Speaker, Hon Uchenna Edward Ubochi and some other dignitaries at the VP Pavilion to save the fight from turning to a free-for-all. Sources told SaharaReporters that trouble started when Nnamani left his seat and went to Edeoga where he was sitting and started accusing him of sponsoring malicious write-ups and unprintable things against him. Edeoga, immediate past Commissioner for Environment was said to have stood to respond to Nnamani's unprovoked aggression. He was said to have denied the accusations. In a video showing the scuffle seen by SaharaReporters, the two could be heard exchanging words with each other. SaharaReporters had reported that Nnamani had a few days back attacked a former Council Chairman, Hon Chiene .I. Chiene during his consultation with PDP delegates from Enugu North and Enugu South at the Enugu North secretariat. Meanwhile, Enugu residents are questioning the mental health of Senator Nnamani especially now that he had won the ticket of PDP Senatorial primary to represent Enugu East Senatorial District at the National Assembly for the third time. When Chijioke Edeoga was contacted for reaction, he said, “What happened is on the Facebook pages. He came to me and verbally assaulted me."
