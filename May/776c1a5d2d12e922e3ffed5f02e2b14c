The Taliban authorities have implemented many changes since August 15, 2021, when it finally took over Afghanistan including the dissolution of some commissions and government departments earlier created by the former Afghan government.According to UK Guardian, officials of the Islamist country on Tuesday said the government had dissolved the Afghanistan’s independent Human Rights Commission and four other key departments, describing them as “unnecessary.” Announcing the dissolution of the commission and departments, the Taliban authorities said the country is currently experiencing a financial downturn as it faces a budget deficit of 44billion Afghanis ($501million) in its current financial year.This is the first time they announced their first annual national budget since August 2021 when the Taliban took over the country.The Taliban government’s deputy spokesperson, Innamullah Samangani, said that “Because these departments were not deemed necessary and were not included in the budget, they have been dissolved.”Samangani also said the national budget was “based on objective facts” which was only intended to be utilised for departments that had been active and productive; adding that the dissolved bodies could be reactivated in the future “if needed.”Among other departments also scrapped were; the High Council for National Reconciliation (HCNR), the National Security Council and the Commission for Overseeing the Implementation of the Afghan Constitution.The HCNR department was headed by the former Afghanistan president, Abdullah Abdullah, through which he was working to negotiate a peace between the US-backed government of former president Ashraf Ghani and the Taliban group.Recall that the Taliban regime, when it took over in 2021, promised to be softer in its rule than their previous regime that lasted from 1996 to 2001.Unfortunately, they strictly denied Afghans, especially women, their freedoms, particularly on access to education, work and dress. They also decreed that women and girls must wear veils, while they must always be accompanied in public places by their male relatives.
