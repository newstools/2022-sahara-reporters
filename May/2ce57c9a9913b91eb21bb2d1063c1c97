The Osun State Chapter of the Accord Party has accused the state governor, Gboyega Oyetola, of awarding fresh contracts worth N3.3billion for a road project in the state, which is already being handled by the Federal Ministry of Works, Abuja. The party, in a statement issued by Victor Akande, the chairman, noted that Oyetola awarding the contract only two months to the governorship election was a source of concern. Governor Gboyega Oyetola The party further alleged that the governor wanted to use the funds for the election. The opposition party further flayed the APC-led government in the state, querying why an administration whose tenure was expected to end in November 2022 would award contracts for roads proposed to be completed in 2023. The statement reads, “We know of a fact that the Federal Government through the Ministry of Works had awarded the contract of this same road (Osogbo-Okinni-Ilobu) to Fariq Interbiz Limited under its Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). “We also know that the said contractor worked on this road up to April this year when water drainages were being constructed. So, what happened along the line? Did Oyetola just wake to realise that this road was in bad taste? Did the FG hand over the road construction to Oyetola to re-award the contract? “For us, it is suspicious that a new contractor called Slavabogu Construction Nigeria Limited is the one engaged by Oyetola to handle the same project. “We are in the season of election and we know that a sitting government will be looking for all means to fleece money. We have full information of how local governments' funds were used for the 2018 governorship election in the state. “As a major opposition party yearning to take over governance, Governor Oyetota should be ready to give an account of his stewardship after governance and understand that he will adequately explain how he spent every kobo of Osun money.”
