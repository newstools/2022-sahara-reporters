Terrorists who attacked an Abuja-Kaduna train and killed eight people have released a fresh hostage video showing their victims in an unidentified location suspected to be a forest.The victims were abducted when bandits attacked the Kaduna-bound train on March 28. Eight passengers were killed during the train attack, while a yet-to-be-confirmed number of persons were kidnapped.A masked terrorist wore a military uniform and stood behind the abductees in the new video obtained by Arise TV.Some of the captives were seen calling on the government to come to their rescue.One of them, identified himself as a Pakistan national, and appealed to the Nigerian government to meet the kidnappers’ demands so they could be freed.The development is coming a few days after the terrorists demanded the release of their children in the custody of the Nigerian government before they could begin negotiation for the release of the abducted train passengers.The gunmen made their demand known when they reached out to one Alhaji Tukur Mamu, an aide to Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, and said they were not interested in money as ransom.One of the terrorists simply identified as Abu Barra told Mamu that their children, among them a year-old boy, were being held at an orphanage home in Yola, Adamawa State capital.He said the children about eight of them were seized from their mothers at Nasarawa State before being taken to Yola by government agents.He emphasised that others had offered millions of naira to them as ransom to release them but they told them it was not about money.
