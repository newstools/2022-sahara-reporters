Barely 24 hours after the suspected killers of Anambra State lawmaker Hon Okechukwu Okoye threatened to kill more people, seven persons were reportedly killed while a police station and some vehicles were ablaze early Monday morning. Among those that were killed, according to sources, were a mother and four of her children at Isulo, Orumba North local government area of the state.  One other person was said to have been killed at Abatete in the Idemili North local government area of the state while another was killed in the Nanka Orumba North local government area. The gunmen also attacked a police station in Anaku in Ayamelum Local Government Area and set vehicles ablaze, one of the sources said. SaharaReporters had reported that Okoye, who represented Aguata II State constituency, was abducted along with his driver in Aguata on May 15, 2022. The lawmaker was later beheaded and his head was found on Saturday at Nnobi, in the Idemili South Council Area of the state. Last Monday, the district office of the Enugu Electricity Distribution Company in Ogidi, a magistrate court and the headquarters of Idemili North Local Government Area were attacked.  The Anambra State Police Command had yet to confirm the development as its spokesman, Ikenga Tochukwu, said details of the incidents were still sketchy.
