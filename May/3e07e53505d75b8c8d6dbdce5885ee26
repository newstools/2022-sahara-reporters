Former Vice President and presidential aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has urged the Nigerian government to ensure absolute security is given to children while in school. Mr Atiku said this on Friday on his official Twitter handle to mark this year's Children's Day celebration.  He said, "On this occasion of Children's Day, I wish to restate my call for a renewed focus on education in Nigeria, with particular attention paid to ensuring that our country's children are safe in their classrooms when they learn. "Equipping our children with a solid education is the best way to enable them to achieve their dreams and surmount whatever challenges that society might throw at them.  On this occasion of Children's Day, I wish to restate my call for a renewed focus on education in Nigeria, with particular attention paid to ensuring that our country's children are safe in their classrooms when they learn.#ChildrensDay  "With a solid education, each Nigerian child will grow to learn that we can all do more when we work together than when we are divided.”  “It is imperative that our children in schools in all parts of Nigeria must study in safety, without fear of being kidnapped, attacked or raped. "Protecting these precious children is a responsibility that the government and security personnel cannot take lightly. By protecting them, we are protecting our country's future and building one future for one Nigeria!" Mr Atiku stated. He equally said, despite being an orphan, education is the tool that changed his fate against all odds he encountered in life. "I know from personal experience how getting an education can transform someone's life and influence their destiny in unimaginable ways. "My background, the loss of my father at an early age and the environment in which I grew up, were all factors that could have counted against me, but my going to school was the game changer; it made all the difference," he narrated.
