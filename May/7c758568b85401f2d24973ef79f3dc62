An American Comedian, Dave Chappelle, was on Tuesday, attacked on stage during a performance in Los Angeles, United States, according to social media posts.Footage circulating on the social media showed Chappelle on stage performing when a man to his right rushed at him and tackled him to the floor. The man was then dragged away by security, according to a report by Hollywood Reporter. NBC News Los Angeles reported that the LAPD had confirmed they had taken a man into custody and that he was armed with a replica gun “that can eject a knife blade” when discharged correctly.It wasn’t immediately clear if the man tried to use the weapon. Police said that Chappelle was not injured in the incident.Chappelle was on the receiving end of heated backlash in 2021 when his Netflix special was dubbed trans-phobic.It was gathered that after the comedian took to the stage to perform on Tuesday, he had joked, “It was a trans man” who attacked him.Jamie Foxx, the Hollywood actor, was among those who ran to the stage to help after the incident. Chris Rock, who was slapped by Will Smith at the Oscars, also performed at the show.Last October, about 100 persons protested outside Netflix’s headquarters over ‘The Closer’, Chappelle’s comedy special.They had opposed the special in which Chappelle said “gender is a fact” and that LGBT people were “too sensitive”.Chappelle’s experience comes after Will Smith, the actor, dealt Chris Rock a slap on the stage at the 2022 Oscars.Rock had, in a joke, mocked Jada Pinkett’s shaved head — something the actress said was due to a hair loss condition.The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) later banned Smith from the Oscars for 10 years.
