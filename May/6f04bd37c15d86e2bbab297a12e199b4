A Nigerian-American scholar and social commentator, Farooq Kperogi, has urged the Sokoto State Government to prosecute and punish the killers of a female student of the Shehu Shagari College of Education in the state.Kperogi, who expressed his displeasure over the sad incident on Thursday, called on the Governor Aminu Tambuwal-led government to ensure the culprits face the wrath of the law. He said the government should “immediately apprehend those behind the killing, and make an example of them.”SaharaReporters had reported earlier how the female student was burnt to death by a group of students for allegedly insulting Prophet Muhammed(SAW).Kperogi said, “I just watched a bloodcurdling video clip of a bunch of murderous, maniacal brutes murdering and burning a Christian woman at the Shehu Shagari College of Education in Sokoto because she allegedly blasphemed Islam, and I’m overwrought with deep anguish,” Kperogi wrote on his social media pages.“The cowardly, homicidal beasts who extra-judicially murdered this Christian woman are the same kinds of people who pray to God to save them from the bandits that have made their communities to perpetually drown in oceans of blood.“They murder fellow humans in their self-imposed “fight for God” but pray to the same God to fight for them when they’re confronted by bloodthirsty bandit. What kind of messed-up human scum are those?“Sadly, this sort of consequence-free murder of people in the name of avenging “blasphemy” has been going on for far too long in the North. This must stop!“The monsters in that video are easily identifiable. The Sokoto State government must immediately apprehend them and make an example of them.“If that doesn’t happen, this kind of murderous barbarism will continue. Nigeria can’t survive indiscriminate, religion-inspired murders of innocent people.”
