The Federal High Court sitting in Osogbo, Osun State capital has declared Senator Ademola Adeleke as the Peoples Democratic Party’s (PDP) authentic candidate that will be the party’s flag bearer in the coming July 16  Osun State governorship election.The declaration was made by the presiding judge, Justice Nathaniel Emmanuel, on Wednesday May 18. The court ruling was sequel to a suit filed by a factional candidate of PDP, Prince Dotun Babayemi challenging Senator Adeleke’s candidacy.Following the parallel primary election the party held in the state on March 9, Prince Babayemi had prayed the court to affirm him as the authentic candidate of the Party.However, the court did not grant his prayers.Adeleke trended recently following his statement that he had come with money in different currencies.“Osun people, you are the one to decide. Don't be scared, if it's about money, I have brought loads of cash. The money is not only in naira, we have brought dollars, pounds sterling, Euro. This time around, it is fire for fire,” he had said.
