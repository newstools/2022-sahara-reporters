4 Days Ago On Wednesday, he submitted his N50 million nomination form at the International Conference Centre. Several sources close to the minister said he withdrew from the race over fear that he may not get the ticket. There has been a cold political war between the incumbent governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu and the political arrowhead of Kebbi, Senator Adamu Alieru over who succeeds the former. While Bagudu, who chairs the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), is rooting for Malami as his successor, Aliero, a two-term governor of the state, has Senate Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi as his preferred candidate for the APC governorship ticket.

2 Weeks Ago Aliero’s camp has Bala Sani Kangiwa, who was removed during the last state congress of the party as their chairman, while the camp of the governor has Abubakar Kana Zuru as chairman. Two secretariats of the APC now exist in Birnin Kebbi, the state capital. Fearing he may not get the ticket under the current circumstances, Malami was said to have changed his plan and pulled out of the governorship race. “He (Malami) actually pulled out of the race because he knows he can’t win without being the Attorney General,” a source told SaharaReporters. Malami, a lawyer from Kebbi State who was hardly known before 2015 when he was appointed into the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, is today one of the richest men in Nigeria. In 2020, a series of detailed investigations carried out by SaharaReporters showed that Malami had acquired several properties whose value run into many billions of naira since being appointed into the administration of President Buhari as Nigeria’s chief law officer.

 Ever since SaharaReporters published a series of detailed reports exposing these illicit acquisitions, the online news medium has been a target for the AGF’s camp. Apart from falsely claiming to have sued SaharaReporters over the expository reports he said had damaged his reputation before the world, Malami also issued a petition to the former Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, on the issue to arrest the publisher of the online newspaper, Omoyele Sowore. Despite these questionable acquisitions, Malami continues to portray a saintly stance in the Buhari government whose fight against corruption has been called into serious question in recent times.
