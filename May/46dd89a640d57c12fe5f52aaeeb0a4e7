Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State, who is a presidential aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has described an allegation by a former National Chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomhole, that he once asked him to rig an election as false.Fayemi said this while reacting to the viral allegation, noting that it was a joke and Nigerians should disregard it. “The allegation, which was made on a national television, is not only false, puerile and laughable, it is a figment of the imagination of the former APC Chairman as Governor Fayemi has never asked Oshiomhole to rig any election for him or any other person and never had any reason to ask for such”, a statement by Fayemi’s spokesman, Mr Yinka Oyebode, said.“Members of the public are therefore urged to disregard the allegations by Comrade Oshiomhole, who apparently is still experiencing a post-traumatic stress disorder on account of his removal as Chairman of APC."It is on record that Dr Fayemi was not responsible for Oshiomhole’s removal as Chairman of the APC. He has his ward executives and the courts to blame for that.“The Ekiti State Governor has always considered Oshiomhole a friend and political associate even if they had fundamental differences over his kangaroo approach of disqualifying Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State, from the APC primaries and his unconscionable autocratic management of party affairs whilst he was chairman of the party"For avoidance of doubt, Governor Fayemi has no reason to approach Oshiomhole for favours for any election. Governor Fayemi has a stellar track record of being a consummate democrat even in difficult times.“Many Nigerians can easily recall his historic concession speech in 2014 in an election that was clearly lost to electoral sleight of hand at the behest of the then People’s democratic Party (PDP) –led Federal Government," Fayemi explained.SaharaReporters had earlier reported that Oshiomhole disclosed that Fayemi once wanted him to commit electoral fraud in the APC which he (Oshiomhole) declined.The former Edo State Governor had stated this in an interview on Channels Television, adding that Governor Fayemi made the request when he (Oshiomhole) served as the sitting chairman of the ruling party.
