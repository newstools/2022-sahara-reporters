Justice O. A. Chijioke of the Abia State High Court on Thursday voided the victory of the winner of the governorship primary election of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Ikechi Emenike.  Emenike had been declared the winner of the governorship primary election which has been immersed in controversy.  Justice Chijioke had while delivering judgement in a suit filed by Mr. Chinedum Nwole and two others, held that Emenike was not a member of APC having been suspended from the party. The judge said Emenike, therefore, lacked the locus standi to contest the primary election.  The court ruled that both Emenike and the chairman of the APC in the state, Chief Donatus Nwakpa breached article 9.3 of the APC constitution by going ahead to participate in the primary election.  It declared that their participation in the ward, local council, state and the recently held national convention of the party was illegal.  The ruling read in part, “That by the virtue of the suspension of the first defendant (Emenike) as a member of the second defendant (APC), the first defendant cannot participate in whatever form whatsoever in the activities of the second defendant including the scheduled ward, local government, state and national congresses of the second defendant due to take place between 2021 and 2022.  “That order of injunction is hereby made restraining the first defendant from parading, dignifying and or posturing himself as a legitimate member of APC during the subsisting of his suspension from the party as prescribed by the constitution.”  Consequently, the judge directed the National Working Committee of the party to desist from having further dealing with the duo based on the subsisting court order.
