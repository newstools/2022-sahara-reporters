This was contained in a statement issued by the Corps’ Director, Press and Public Relations, Eddy Megwa, and obtained by SaharaReporters.According to Shuaibu, the physical and mental health of all drivers is very critical to their overall performance, as he noted that only a healthy driver would be alert as well as be efficient in driving.“He stated further that in order to avoid fatal road accidents, all drivers must take their health seriously and adopt healthy lifestyles.“He said road accidents have claimed many lives in recent times with some of the causative factors attributable to stress, sleep deprivation, fatigue, drunkenness, illness, bad eyesight, and drug abuse, among others,” the statement added.   The DG noted that the management was committed to the enhancement of the welfare and efficiency of workers and would also intensify efforts aimed at safe driving among NYSC drivers."Apart from regular servicing of vehicles, we have accorded priority attention to the drivers' health, especially through routine medical checks. Don't joke with your health because you are very important to us and we cherish you. Be very honest in your dealings and we don't want to hear any case of misconduct from any of you. I am happy that NYSC Staff are very wonderful people," he said.He further advised the workshop participants who were drawn from all NYSC formations across the country to adhere to approved speed limits, carry out necessary checks on their vehicles before driving, and avoid alcoholic drinks, and night journeys, among other risks.
