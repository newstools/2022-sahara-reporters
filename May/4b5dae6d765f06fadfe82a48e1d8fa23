Gunmen on Monday invaded the premises of Anambra Broadcasting Service (ABS), Awada, Onitsha station.  Although no life was lost in the attack, a building and buses used by the company for its operations were damaged and burnt.  There have been deadly attacks in Anambra lately despite Governor Charles Soludo’s decision to offer amnesty to gunmen terrorising the state.  The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has been linked to the attacks in the state but the secessionist has denied having any hand in the violence.  Soludo had recently visited the leader of the group, Nnamdi Kanu, who is being remanded in the custody of the Department of State Services (DSS) in Abuja.  The governor who shared pictures of himself and Kanu via social media recently said the IPOB leader was against the attacks and killings by gunmen in the South East.  According to him, the IPOB leader wished he had the opportunity to give a broadcast to address the situation.
