The immediate past Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi has insisted that he is qualified to be the President of Nigeria based on his trajectory.  He noted this while meeting with delegates of the All Progressives Congress in Jigawa.  The former Rivers State Governor appealed to them to vote for him because he is a competent and detribalised Nigerian.  According to him, of all the aspirants seeking the presidential seat, he is the person with both the legislative and executive experiences, saying these experiences have made him understand Nigeria better.  “Judge me by past records, not what people think and say I am. I have to be the president of Nigeria because of my trajectory.  “It would not be fair for the north to abandon the south-south in its hours of need because of the long-standing political relationship between the two regions,” he was quoted as saying.  Responding, Governor Muhammad Badaru of Jigawa, said he will not contest against Amaechi in the 2023 presidential election.  “There will be no contest between me and Ameachi. It is either I run or he runs, but for sure, I cannot run against him,” he said.  Amaechi, some days ago announced his resignation from the President Muhammadu Buhari’s cabinet to focus on his 2023 Presidential ambition.  Buhari had about a week ago ordered his ministers and appointees with political ambition to resign.  Though some ministers complied immediately, Amaechi and others stayed on.  However, the minister finally tendered his resignation and it was contained in a statement by the Amaechi Presidential Media Committee, signed by Kingsley Wali.
