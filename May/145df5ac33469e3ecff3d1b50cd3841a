The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has forcefully entered the residence of Senator Rochas Okorocha in Abuja and picked him up. This comes after sporadic gunshots were heard in the vicinity.  The EFCC had arrived at Okorocha’s residence in Maitama on Tuesday morning to arrest him but were unable to gain entrance into the house.The operatives were seen in a video parading the premises of the former governor. They insisted that Okorocha, who is seeking to contest the presidential election on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), should submit himself for arrest or honour a long-standing invitation to their office.The anti-graft agency, after hours of laying siege to the house, however, picked up Okorocha on Tuesday evening and whisked him away.The EFCC had also insisted that journalists must leave the premises, forcefully ejecting everyone in the residence. The former governor is being investigated by the anti-graft corruption for allegedly stealing state funds while in office. In January, the anti-graft agency had charged the senator with allegations he conspired with others to steal N2.9 billion from public coffers. EFCC filed the charges at the Federal High Court, Abuja. In addition to Okorocha, other defendants are Anyim Nyerere Chinenye, Naphtali International Limited, Perfect Finish Multi Projects Limited, Consolid Projects Consulting Limited, Pramif International Limited, and Legend World Concepts Limited. The charges were filed about the same time Okorocha declared his intention to run for the office of the president in 2023.
