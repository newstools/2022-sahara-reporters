The Minister of State for Petroleum, Timipre Sylva, has pulled out of the 2023 presidential race in the All Progressives Congress (APC) and returned to his work. According to the News Agency of Nigeria, the minister, who disclosed this in Abuja on Monday, said he withdrew his presidential ambition having "considered the enormous work at the ministry."  The outlet also quoted a source in his ministry as saying Sylva withdrew from "the race to support President Muhammadu Buhari in his quest to achieve a robust oil sector." The source said, “He promised to consult the leader of the country and his political leaders the day he was presented with the form. “He believes that concentrating on his work will attract more investments for the oil and gas sector. “He has consulted and he believes that the challenges at the ministry and oil and gas sector are enough issues for him to begin to deal with now than going to pursue presidential ambition at the expense of the nation. Horatious Egua, the Senior Special Assistant to the minister on media, also confirmed that the minister was back to work. Sylva now joins his colleagues, Chris Ngige, who is the Minister of Labour and Employment, and the Minister of Justice and Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, to back out of their 2023 political ambitions and hold on to their ministerial positions.
