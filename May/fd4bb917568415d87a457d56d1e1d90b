A woman who gave her name as Mrs Kezia Robinson Uwak has raised an alarm on Twitter about alleged attempts by her husband, Robinson Uwak, to kill her. She alleged that her husband, a former federal lawmaker, attempted to kill her to prevent her from leaving their marriage.  Robinson Uwak was a member of the House of Representatives who represented Oron, Mbo, Okobo,Ure-Offong/Oruko and Udung-uko federal constituency of Akwa Ibom State at the 7th Assembly Kezia had tweeted on her Twitter account @UwakKezia, on Sunday: "My “husband”, HON. ROBINSON UWAK STRANGLED ME and ATTEMPTED to kill me when HE FOUND OUT I WAS TRYING to leave the marriage & he did this right in the room where my children were asleep."   My âhusbandâ, HON. ROBINSON UWAK STRANGLED ME and ATTEMPTED to kill me when HE FOUND OUT I WAS TRYING to leave the marriage & he did this right in the room where my children were asleep. pic.twitter.com/OcleOhsbEr  Twitter users condemned the violence and advised her to report to a police station immediately before it turned into a case similar to that of the late singer, Osinachi Nwachukwu, who was allegedly killed by her husband, Peter.  A Twitter user, TundeDessy, immediately tweeted: "African will always listen to one side of the story and conclude. Did you overpower him and retrieved (sic) those weapons for snapping? You said he wanted to kill you? No doubt, did he later change his mind and drop the weapons for photo op. I condemn all forms of domestic violence."
