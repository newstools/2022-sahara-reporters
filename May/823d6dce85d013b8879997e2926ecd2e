Sani had vowed not to bribe delegates to vote for him. ”No one should pay any delegate on my behalf. I don’t believe in the political rituals of paying to be elected. That is inconsistent with my ideological and moral beliefs,” Sani said before the election on Wednesday, according to Premium Times. Sani, who secured just two votes, was defeated by a former member of the House of Representatives, Isah Ashiru, in the race for the PDP governorship ticket.
