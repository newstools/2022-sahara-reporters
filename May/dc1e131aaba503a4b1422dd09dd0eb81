Professor Ibrahim Maqari, an Islamic cleric and Deputy Chief Imam of Abuja's National Mosque has supported the lynching of Deborah Samuel Yakubu, a Christian student of Shehu Shagari College of Education Sokoto by her colleagues. According to the cleric who conducted the wedding of the daughter of President Muhammad Buhari, Zara, Muslims should not be blamed for harming those who insulted Prophet Muhammad (SAW).  “It should be known to everyone that we the Muslims have some redlines beyond which MUST NOT be crossed. The dignity of the Prophet (PBUH) is at the forefront of the redlines. “If our grievances are not properly addressed, then we should not be criticized for addressing them ourselves,” he posted on his Twitter account. pic.twitter.com/NfZUWG8BGp
