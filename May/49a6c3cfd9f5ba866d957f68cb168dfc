Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River state has sacked the paramount ruler of Calabar south council, Itam Hogan Itam for attending a meeting organised by the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Mr. Itam had reportedly attended a meeting of the Cross River South Senatorial District PDP caucus.  The PDP at the meeting presided over by the former Cross River Governor, Donald Duke, reportedly endorsed the Chancellor of Arthur Jarvis University, Arthur Jarvis as a consensus governorship candidate of the party for the 2023 general elections. Itam’s attendance at the meeting was said to have violated the Cross River State traditional edict. He was therefore accused of meddling in politics. In a letter signed by the Special Adviser to the Governor on Chieftaincy Affairs, Adoga Victor, Governor Ayade directed Itam to immediately return the certificate of recognition to the state’s department of chieftaincy affairs in the governor’s office. The letter dated May 11 and quoted by TheCable read, “Following the report of the panel set up by the Cross River State Traditional Rulers Council (CRSTRC) and the approval of His Excellency, you have been removed as the village head, clan head of Ukem and paramount ruler of Efuts with immediate effect to enable you go ahead to do your partisan politics,” the letter reads. “You have therefore ceased to be so recognised and cannot operate as such forthwith.” Ayade who became the governor on the platform of the PDP later defected to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) where he is currently among the party's presidential aspirants. However, Ayade was recently quoted as saying he would step down for former President Goodluck Jonathan if he (Jonathan) secures the APC presidential ticket.
