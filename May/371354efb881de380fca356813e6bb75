The European Union has declared its plan to place a total ban on the Russian oil embargo, banning the import of crude oil in the next six months and refined oil products by the end of 2022, New York Times reports. This was made known by the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, who presented the broad outlines of a new, sixth package of E.U. sanctions against Russia.  “Finally, we now propose a ban on Russian oil. Let´s be clear: it will not be easy. But we simply have to work on it. We will make sure that we phase out Russian oil in an orderly fashion. To maximise pressure on Russia, while minimising the impact on our economies,” von der Leyen said in a tweet. The move came as the United States and its allies were also trying to capitalise on Russia’s slow progress on the battlefield by escalating their efforts to weaken its military and tip the war’s balance toward Ukraine. The United States and Britain have been sending a stream of increasingly powerful arms, and Russia’s Nordic neighbours — Finland and Sweden — are inching closer to joining NATO.
