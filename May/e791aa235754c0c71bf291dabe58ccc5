A presidential aspirant from the South-East region on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Anyim Pius Anyim, has expressed concern over the absence of the list of Ebonyi State delegates from the presidential primaries. He raised the alarm in an open letter addressed to the PDP National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, and Chairman of the PDP Special Convention, David Mark. Pius Anyim Anyim’s letter is coming barely 24 hours after a fellow South-East top presidential aspirant and former Anambra State governor, Peter Obi, dumped the party for the Labour Party, citing “irregularities” in the PDP. Anyim said he had gone through the list of delegates from states for the National Convention scheduled on Saturday and Sunday, May 28 to May 29 in Abuja, but he could not find that of Ebonyi. He said despite assurances by the party's National Organising Secretary, the Ebonyi list was yet to be added, warning that the absence of the Ebonyi delegates’ list would not augur well for the party. “The Chairman may recall that during the meeting of Presidential aspirants and the Special Convention Committee held on May 26 at the Legacy House that the entire delegates list for all the states was presented to each of the aspirants. “On examining the list, I discovered that the Ebonyi delegates list was not included. On inquiry from the National Organising Secretary, he informed me that there was a technical error and it will be corrected today. “As at the time of writing this letter i.e. noon Friday, May 27, I have no clue about the fate of the delegates from Ebonyi. The purpose of this letter is to alert all concerned that disenfranchising delegates from Ebonyi or any state for that matter will fundamentally affect the election,” he said.
