Gunmen suspected to be Fulani herdsmen have shot dead Christopher, elder brother of Benue State Commissioner for Information, Culture and Tourism, Michael Inalegwu. The victim, according to reports, was shot by the assailants while on his farm at Aku Village in Okololo Ward under Agatu Local Government Area.  It was gathered that the gunmen, who strayed into his farm, shot him at about 10:00am on Monday and ran away. The commissioner described the attack as unprovoked, adding that suspected “herders gunned down Christopher, his only surviving sibling right in his farm”. Inalegwu said that despite the killing of his brother, the state will not surrender to the caprices of evil men marauding as herders. He explained that his brother was moved from two hospitals before he gave up the ghost due to the severity of the gunshots. “Fulani opened fire on him at his farm in Aku in Agatu. We cannot be cajoled to submit our land to Fulani,” he said. The commissioner, however, assured that the state government would do everything possible to mobilise security agents to Gwer West and Agatu areas of the state where the inhabitants are presently under attack by herders.
