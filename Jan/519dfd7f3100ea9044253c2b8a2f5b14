Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo has disclosed that former governor of Oyo State who died recently, Adebayo Alao-Akala, was generous to him.

Yemi Osinbajo The vice president said he had known late Alao-Akala before he became the governor of Oyo State. He spoke on Sunday during a condolence visit to the family of Alao-Akala who died on January 12, 2022, in Ogbomoso. Osinbajo said, “Long before I became a professor of law, I had known our dear uncle Adebayo Alao-Akala; anytime I think about him I smile because he was a very special being. “Professor Oyelowo Oyewo was my link to him; everybody knew he was his nephew. So, then, if we needed a little pocket money, we found a way of getting to our dear uncle Alao-Akala even long before he became governor of Oyo State. “He was among the top few people I first contacted when I was nominated as the vice-presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2015 and he offered his advice. “Alao-Akala was exceedingly generous. His death was touching. I pray for you the children, wives and close relatives. You will be greater than he was, and all his aspirations for you will be fulfilled.”
