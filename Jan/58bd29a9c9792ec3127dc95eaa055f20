President Muhammadu Buhari has mourned the late Olubadan of Ibadan land, Oba Saliu Adetunji. The monarch died at the University College Hospital in Ibadan, Oyo State, on Sunday.  While extending his condolence to the royal family, Buhari described the late monarch as a visionary and compassionate leader. This was contained in a statement issued on Sunday by the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina. The statement read, “The President affirms that the late Kabiyesi was a visionary and compassionate leader, who used the spheres of his influence as a respected traditional ruler and a lover of the creative industry to advance the progress of his people, encouraging and motivating them to give their best in their vocation and to the nation. “While his demise understandably leaves a huge void to fill, the President urges the people of Ibadan and Nigerians from different walks of life to honour the eternal memory of the deceased by imbibing the virtues he cherished so much: generosity, peace, tolerance and devotion to unity. “As the funeral rites of the 41st Olubadan of Ibadanland get underway in Ibadan, the President trusts that the process of selecting his successor will be guided by wisdom, understanding and good judgment that exemplified the life he lived. “President Buhari prays God to grant the soul of Oba Adetunji eternal rest and comfort the family, friends, associates and subjects he left behind.”
