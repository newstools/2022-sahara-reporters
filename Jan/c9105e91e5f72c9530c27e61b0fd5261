Anybody who wants my advice, I will always be there in the best interest of Nigeria.“Whatever I do in my own life…because I became president on the platform of PDP, PDP will continue to be part of my life. Since the day I tore my PDP card, that was the day I ceased to be a member of PDP. That day I vowed not to be a member of any political party.“I will continue to be a statesman.”Obasanjo told Ayu that he has the problems of PDP and Nigeria on his shoulders, and prayed God give him the wisdom to carry it.Responding, Ayu told Obasanjo that “if you leave PDP, the blood of PDP will never leave you”.He said the party would always require his advice regarding governance in Nigeria.
