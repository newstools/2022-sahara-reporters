 Human rights’ activist, Omoyele Sowore, has vowed to file a lawsuit against the Director-General of the Department of State Services, Yusuf Bichi Magaji, the Director-General, National Identity Management Commission, Aliyu Aziz, and the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, over the deactivation of his means of identification. Other defendants in the proposed suit will be the Inspector General of Police, Alkali Baba, the Chief of Defence Staff, Lucky Irabor, the National Security Adviser, Babagana Monguno, the Comptroller General of the Nigerian Immigration Service, Muhammed Babandede and the Chairman, the Independent National Electoral Commission, Mahmood Yakubu. Recall that Sowore's National Identity Card, Permanent Voter's Card and International Passport were deactivated by the President Muhammadu Buhari’s regime without giving any reason. In the petition signed by Sowore's legal counsel, Barrister Tope Temokun, describing the Nigerian government’s action as “reckless political persecution taken too far,” all the respondents were given seven days to activate Sowore’s means of identification or be dragged to court. The petition was titled, “UNLAWFUL AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL DEACTIVATION OF THE NATIONAL IDENTITY NUMBER OF OMOYELE SOWORE AS 2023 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION DRAWS NEAR AS A RECKLESS POLITICAL PERSECUTION TAKEN TOO FAR!" It was read in full, "We are Solicitors to Omoyele Sowore, the founder/publisher of Sahara Reporters, an online news agency, a Nigerian foremost human rights activist, a pro-democracy campaigner and a one-time presidential aspirant (hereinafter referred to as “Our Client”), and on whose behalf and express instruction we write as hereunder appearing.
