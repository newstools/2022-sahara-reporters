Gladys Binniyat has cried out that her husband, the spokesperson of the Southern Kaduna Peoples Union (SOKAPU), Luka Binniyat, is terribly sick in the detention of security agents in Kaduna State. She also said Luka had been unable to walk since Tuesday. Punchng


Binniyat, who is also a freelance journalist with Epoch Times, a United States-based publication has reportedly been in detention since November 4, 2021, on the orders of the Commissioner of Internal Security and Home Affairs in the state, Samuel Aruwan.All efforts to get Luka out of the custody through to bail have been futile.Mrs Binniyat disclosed this on Thursday, as she decried the treatment given to him at the prison clinic, stating that he should be taken to a better medical facility.Gladys said, “He called me on Tuesday saying that his legs are giving him issues. He said they were swollen and he could not work.“He was rushed to the prison clinic in a wheelchair. They just bandaged his legs and he gave them money to buy drugs which he used.“They took him back to the cell, before they attended to him. I don’t have confidence in the treatment they gave to him, he complained of pains at around 7am and you gave him treatment by 6pm. If it was something that would have killed him that was how they would have left him to die.“I saw him this morning. His legs are still swollen and can’t walk. I want them to release my husband for me so that he can be taken care of. I am not sure of the kind of drugs given to him, I don’t trust them. I want him to be taken to a good medical facility for proper checkup and treatment.”
