The operatives of Ogun State Police have arrested a pastor in Abeokuta for allegedly sleeping with a woman and her two daughters. The pastor identified as Timothy Oluwatimilehin was in charge of the Spirit-Filled International Christian Church in the Olumore area of the state, the police authorities said on Thursday.  Police spokesperson in the state, Abimbola Oyeyemi, on Thursday disclosed this in a statement, saying the arrest followed a complaint lodged at Adatan Police Station by the victims’ husband. Accompanied by an official of the Ministry of Women Affairs, he reported that his wife and two daughters were lured by their church pastor, who took them into custody and had since been sleeping with them. “Upon the report, the Divisional Police Officer, Adatan division, Superintendent of Police, Abiodun Salau detailed his detectives to effect the arrest of the randy pastor,” the police spokesman said. Oyeyemi said the suspect confessed to having committed the crime but pleaded for forgiveness, adding that the suspect took advantage of a little misunderstanding between the woman and her husband to carry out the act. Meanwhile, Commissioner of Police in the state, Lanre Bankole, has directed the Anti-Human Trafficking and Child Labour Unit of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department to take over the case and diligently investigate it with a view to charging the suspect to court as soon as possible.
