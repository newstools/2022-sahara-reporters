Roads in Ebonyi State seemed as a graveyard on Tuesday morning as residents complied with an order of the Indigenous People of Biafra to boycott economic and business activities. Also, shops in major markets were shut, as no single person was seen in the markets.  IPOB spokesperson, Emma Powerful, has said in a statement that all residents of South East region should observe sit-at-home on Tuesday to show solidarity for its leader, Nnamdi Kanu, who appeared at the Federal High Court in Abuja today, Tuesday. In reaction to the sit-at-home, Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi, through his Commissioner for Market and Park, Nwachukwu Eze, had said there would be severe punishment for anyone who obeyed the IPOB orders. “All markets and parks leaderships in Ebonyi are by this announcement directed to ensure that markets are open for businesses on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.  “The state is not in any way part of the sit-at-home order by IPOB. “Please note that strict compliance to this directive is very important as failure to do so will attract severe punishment,” Eze had said.
