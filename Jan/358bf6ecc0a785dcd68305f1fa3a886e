Some members of the All Progressives Congress Members have demonstrated at the Ekiti State Secretariat of the party in Ado-Ekiti, accusing Governor Kayode Fayemi of bribing Abdullahi Sule-led Primary Election Committee to ensure that his “anointed” candidate, Biodun Oyebanji, a former Secretary to Ekiti State Government, emerged flagbearer of the party ahead of the June 18, 2022 election in the state.  SaharaReporters observed at the secretariat how the protesters chanted different solidarity songs, while asking the Yobe State governor, Mai Mala Buni, who heads the APC’s Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee to dissolve the committee. They also raised the alarm over decision of committee to parade Fayemi’s appointees, aides and state Assembly members as electoral umpires to pave way for Oyebanji.
