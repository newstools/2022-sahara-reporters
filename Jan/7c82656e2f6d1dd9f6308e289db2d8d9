The Kwara State Police Command has said claims that the fleeing Zamfara State bandits kingpin, Bello Turji, has relocated to an unidentified forest in the state, are untrue. Spokesman of the command, Okasanmi Ajayi, in Ilorin on Wednesday, said it was necessary to clarify the claims to diffuse the tension already created in the minds of the public by the statement by a Federal lawmaker in the House of Representatives claiming the kingpin and his gang had relocated to an unidentified forest in Kwara State.  “However, the statement by the lawmaker did not reveal the source or veracity of its assertion,” the police spokesman noted, assuring that “Kwara State is safe and secure.” Okasanmi said “All the boundaries, both local and international within the state have been well and massively policed by both the police and the military. “Vigilante and local hunters are working tirelessly with security agents to ensure our forests are well monitored and protected,” he added. He disclosed that the state Police Commissioner, Tuesday Assayomo, had directed a 24-hour patrol of all entry and exit points to the state, while tactical units had been re-energised with the provision of additional patrol vehicles and other needed tools and incentives to aid their performance. The commissioner also advised the public to make information of strange movements and activities around them available to the security agencies at all times. Recall that the news of the bandits’ kingpin, Bello Turji and his gang went viral to the effect that he had relocated to Kwara State, following the onslaught by security forces on their hideouts in Zamfara State, recently.
