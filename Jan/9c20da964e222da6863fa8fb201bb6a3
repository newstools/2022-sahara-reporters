A third monarch from Yoruba land has joined his ancestors on Tuesday. The deceased monarch is the Olupo of Olupona, Oba Emmanuel Onaolapo Oyebanji.  Olupona is the headquarters of Ayedire South Local Development Area of Osun State. The news comes barely 24 hours after it was reported that the father of Senator Iyiola Omisore, a former deputy governor of Osun State and two-time lawmaker representing Osun East Senatorial District, Oba David Omisore, the Olu of Olode, passed on. Oba Omisore turned 90 in July 2021. Recall that on Sunday, Oba Saliu Adetunji, the Olubadan of Ibadan, died at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Oyo State. The monarch, who was the 41st king of the ancient city, has been buried according to Islamic rites.
