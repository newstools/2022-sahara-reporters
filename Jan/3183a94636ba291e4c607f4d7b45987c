Anyone making efforts to bring the house to ruin, we are warning you now. You might be thinking that the one you have done before, nothing was done against you and now you want to try another, don't dare. “We learnt that some people want to burn down the house, but we are warning them not to try it because Igboho had not done anything wrong. The government is just after him for nothing. At the moment, they've chased him to the Benin Republic. He has been there for six months now.”
