The proprietor of Noble Kids Nursery and Primary School, Kawana, Kano, Abdulmalik Tanko has narrated how he used a N100 rat poison to kill his school kid, a five-year-old Hanifa Abubakar. SaharaReporters had reported how Tanko masterminded the abduction of Hanfia, while on her way from Islamiyya School in December and subsequently killed.  Tanko had demanded a N6million ransom from the parents of the child and in the process of collecting part of the money, he was arrested. He had failed to disclose that the victim had been killed. When he was arrested at the Kano Police Command headquarters on Friday, he told journalists that he poisoned the girl with a rat poison that he bought for N100.  Tanko had earlier confessed that he killed the girl because she could recognise him. According to him, the abductor first took her to his wife, but the wife rejected to keep her. “I now took her to Tudunwada area. I laced her tea with rat poison,” he added. Meanwhile, there was a mild drama at the headquarters of the Kano State Police Command when Fatima Maina, mother of a slain five-year-old pupil, Hanfia Abubakar, charged at the proprietor who was arrested in connection with the death of the student.
