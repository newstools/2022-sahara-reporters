Many persons in Enugu State have sustained injuries following a stampede that occurred at Old Park, Okpara Avenue axis on Monday morning. According to reports, while the cause of the stampede had yet to be established, people were said to be running helter-skelter after some people who identified as members of the Indigenous People of Biafra came to enforce the earlier suspended Monday sit-at-home at commercial areas of the state. Punch reports that some motorists and traders at the Ogbete Main Market were seriously injured following the stampede, which erupted at 9am, while several vehicles were damaged as a result of the log jam the incident created.A senior police officer said security had been beefed up around the Enugu maximum correctional centre located at Old Park axis to ensure that there was no attack on the facility.He said, “Our men have been deployed to strategic locations around the Maximum Correctional Centre at the Old Park and other government institutions within the state capital.“This morning, we received a report of stampede around Old Park, Okpara Avenue, Ogbete Main Market and Coal Camp areas that members of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra were enforcing Monday sit-at-home order which had earlier been suspended by the same group around September 2021.“But it turned out that it was a rumour because we have not seen anything yet to suggest such. However, as I said, our operatives have been deployed to strategic locations to forestall any breakdown of law and order in the state.”
