The sit-at-home order issued by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) in solidarity with its leader, Nnamdi Kanu, who appeared in court on Tuesday, was duly observed in Imo State. It was learnt that residents of Imo State, especially Orlu town and Owerri municipal, on Tuesday, stayed indoors to observe the sit-at-home.  The Federal High Court in Abuja on Tuesday adjourned the trial of the leader of Kanu to Wednesday. The case was adjourned by the court to enable Kanu to take his plea on the new counts in the charge. Meanwhile, Imo State secretariat, motor parks, schools, banks, shops and markets across the major cities were all shut down, while major roundabouts and roads were scanty. In Orlu, the ever-busy Banana junction and Okwudo junction were more like ghost towns.
