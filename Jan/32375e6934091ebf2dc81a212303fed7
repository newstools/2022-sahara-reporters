 Some political thugs were seen shooting to scare protesting members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) at secretariat of the party in Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State, on Thursday morning. This was revealed in a video posted by AIT on its Twitter page.  People were seen running and scampering for protection as thugs shot sporadically at the secretariat, while security operatives have done little or nothing to check them. While nobody was recorded dead or injured as at the time of filing this report, the reason behind the shooting might not be unconnected with internal crisis revolving around the APC governorship primary election scheduled for today.
