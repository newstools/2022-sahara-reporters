Traders at the Akure spare parts market, Ondo State, on Tuesday staged a protest over alleged imposition of one Kayode Olorunfemi as their leader. The traders, who accused the Deji of Akure, Oba Aladetoyinbo Aladelusi, of imposing Olorunfemi on them, urged the local authorities to intervene before the matter took a dangerous dimension.  Kole Amueyinoge, leader of the protesters, asserted that they were tired of the continued imposition of Olorunfemi as head of the market even after they extended his tenure by 12 months. He said, “We also visited the local government authorities who organised a peace meeting with the traders and we all signed a peace accord with Olorunfemi who promised to vacate the seat last December, while an interim committee will be put in place. “We are surprised to learn that the committee has been halted not to conduct an election until further notice and Kayode should continue as our chairman. “We will resist Kayode to lead the traders in Mojere market, he has caused more atrocities in the market. The Deji of Akure had installed him as the Asoju Oba in the market and should step aside from contesting for the chairmanship position. “The Deji of Akure should not meddle into the leadership of the market as we pay directly to the local government. The local government is in charge of the market and we have informed them.” However, Olorunfemi in his response insisted that he remained chairman of the spare parts market. He said, “I am not bothered by their noise. Those making noise are not traders in the market. I decided to stay off the market in order not to disrupt the peace in the market.” Chief Press Secretary to Deji of Akure, Micheal Adeyeye, noted that the monarch had no special interest in any of the candidates jostling for leadership of the market. "Deji of Akure only installed a traditional leader in the market and not a chairman," he added.
