Financial Times, the top London-based publication, has taken a swipe at the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration since 2014.In an article published on Monday, the newspaper said Nigerians will feel better if Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, was elected president. “If Yemi Osinbajo, the technocratic Vice President, were miraculously to make it through the campaign ticket and emerge as president, the hearts of Nigerian optimists would beat a little faster,” it said.“But that may be to underestimate the depth of Nigeria’s quagmire. The problem is not so much who leads the government as the nature of government itself."According to the newspaper, the Buhari administration failed to tackle the country's insecurity, Nigeria's debt profile increased under his watch. “Buhari has overseen two terms of economic slump, rising debt and a calamitous increase in kidnapping and banditry – the one thing you might have thought a former general could control," the newspaper added.“Next year, many of the members of government will change, though not necessarily the bureaucracy behind it.“Campaigning has already begun for presidential elections that in February 2023 will draw the curtain on eight years of the administration of Muhammadu Buhari, on whose somnolent watch Nigeria has sleepwalked closer to disaster.”The newspaper also said financial strength has remained a crucial determinant of the country's election winners.The media outlet said Nigeria’s presidential election is estimated to cost $2billion.“Familiar candidates to replace him (Buhari), mostly recycled old men, are already counting their money ahead of a costly electoral marathon. "It takes an estimated $2billion to get a president elected. Those who pay will expect to be paid back,” it added.
