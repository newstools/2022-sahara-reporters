The Kano State Police Command has cleared the air on why its operatives were deployed to arrest a former Kano State Commissioner for Works and Infrastructure, Muazu Magaji.Magaji, a staunch critic of Governor Abdullahi Ganduje, was arrested by the police in Abuja shortly after granting an interview on Trust TV in Abuja on Thursday night.
