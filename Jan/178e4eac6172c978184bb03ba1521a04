As of this morning, (Saturday), we are yet to completely subdue the fire due to the nature of the items kept there. But we have restricted it to a place. It can’t spread again. “We have not done a comprehensive investigation yet but we strongly suspect bush burning, maybe triggered by cigarette butts. “However, we have been able to restrict it to a place.
