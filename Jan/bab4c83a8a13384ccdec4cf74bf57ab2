In a letter to President Muhammadu Buhari and copied to the Chief of Defence Staff, Chief of Army Staff, Senate president, Speaker of the House of Representatives and the international community including the British and United States governments, the group disclosed that Akure was killed on January 15, 2022 by personnel of the Nigerian Army and his mangled body found the next day. The letter signed by T.D. Sorkaa, a solicitor to Mr Solomon Semaka and the Save Nigeria Group, reads, "Our brief further reveals through the chairman, BIRS, in a statement after his death that the late Sixtus was whisked away by military personnel in what has become a regular occurrence, and his body was found around Aper Aku Estate by the roadside."Moreover, our brief reveals, according to Ukan Kuru, a social media activist, from information he gathered from the late Sixtus' close relative that some men of the Nigerian Army came in their truck at the North Bank tax point to intimidate BIRS officers on duty. "Colleagues of the late Sixtus all fled but as a senior officer he stood his grounds to know what the problem was."The Nigerian Army officers descended on him, beating and forcing him into the their vehicle and taking him to unknown location, only for his body to be found the following morning by the roadside."SNG went on to appeal to President Buhari to use his position as Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to within seven days set up an inquiry to unravel the cause of Akure's death and the Nigerian Army's involvement.The group further demanded a compensation of N500million to the family of the deceased.A Nigerian Army spokesperson contacted over the matter declined to comment.
