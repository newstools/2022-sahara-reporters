A former Minister of Aviation, Mbazulike Amaechi, has said that leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, can be released either by legal means or political solution. The elder statesman disclosed that he still trusted President Muhammadu Buhari to consider a political solution in the case of Kanu.  He said that the President would fulfil his promise to explore a political solution to Kanu’s matter despite a statement made by the Buhari during a recent interview. Recall that Amaechi had led some Igbo leaders to meet with Buhari in November last year to seek Kanu’s release amidst the call for a political solution. The President had during the meeting told the delegation that the request for an unconditional release of the IPOB leader was a hard nut to crack as it runs contrary to the doctrine of separation of powers between the executive and judiciary. He, however, promised to consider the request. Speaking in an interview with the PUNCH, Amaechi said Kanu’s situation can be solved either politically by President Buhari or even legally by the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN). He said, “Kanu’s situation can be solved either politically or even legally. It can be solved legally by the Attorney-General. When I met the President, he told me he would consider my request on Nnamdi Kanu. “There are many ways to kill a rat. So, I have no reason to doubt the President. People need to trust him because he is not the type of President who talks without knowing what he is saying. He is a highly principled man. “I don’t think the President has reneged on what he told me. He has so far not. All I know is that discussions are going on. I can’t tell you more than that. We are in contact and I have trust in the President’s words.”
