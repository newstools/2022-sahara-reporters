A suspected human trafficker identified as Mnena Kwaghmande has arrested by Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps, Benue State Command. The suspect, who was with six young girls between the ages of 16 and 20 years and all ready to travel to Burkina-Faso, was intercepted in the Gboko area of Benue State on January 5, 2022. LIB Commandant of the NSCDC in Benue, Philip Okoh, paraded the suspect and victims, noting that the girls were reportedly picked from the Vandeikya Local Government Area of the state. Okoh explained that the suspect when interrogated claimed to have told parents of the girls that they would be helping her in her restaurant in Burkina Faso. He said, “We are showing to the public what we have done so far in terms of securing Benue State and ensuring peace. “Behind me, we have a seasoned trafficker who goes about luring unsuspecting parents through convincing them that they are going abroad for greener pastures. “Investigation has revealed that they were taking them to Burkina Faso. We did this operation in conjunction with NAPTIP." Okoh cautioned parents against releasing their children to people who promised greener pastures abroad, noting that it often leads to disappointment.
