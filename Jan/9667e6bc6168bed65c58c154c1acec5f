They were said to have been arrested “for conspiracy and murder of Inspector Adebayo Adele,” who was reportedly killed on September 20, 2021, at Imeko-Afon area of Ogun. The local security outifit boss explained that the Inspector identified as Adele was macheted to death when he led a team of policemen to arrest the suspects. He disclosed that Aminu Azeez, a butcher by profession, was alleged to have bought stolen cows belonging to a complainant based in Ibadan. But when the IRT team arrived at Imeko to arrest Aminu Azeez, he and his accomplices “resisted arrest, and instigated others to attack the team.” “In the course of the assault on the police team, the suspects macheted one Inspector Adebayo Adele, a member of the team which led to his death,” he said. He added that the suspects were arrested on January 2, 2022, adding that they had been transferred to the IRT team, Ibadan, for further investigation, as search for other suspects continued.
