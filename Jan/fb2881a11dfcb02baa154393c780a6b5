Governor Sanwo-Olu had on Tuesday visited the area where he called on the parties in the tussle to stand down, in a bid to completely resolve the matter.“We have actually started a committee meeting, but I want to invite them (judgment creditors) again officially to my office tomorrow (Wednesday) by 11am to come over with two or three of their representatives,” he had said during the visit.“The State Government representatives will be there, the residents’ association will be there, and the police will also be there. So whatever it is that must have brought about all these troubles and heartaches will need to be brought there.“We will all go through every line of it and we will come to an amicable resolution. So, I want everyone to please ensure that peace will be restored to the estate. I want all of our citizens to go about their lawful businesses knowing fully well that nobody will be harassed or any property will be trampled upon pending all of these conversations,” the governor had added.SaharaReporters had reported that the CSP, Abimbola Oyewole, on Tuesday openly defied Sanwo-Olu’s order to vacate Magodo Phase 2 Estate.The CSP told the governor that he and his armed colleagues were at the estate on the orders of the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba; as well as the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami.Sanwo-Olu had led members of his cabinet to visit the residents protesting the continuous presence of armed policemen in the estate.For days, policemen besieged the estate in the company of suspected land grabbers and members of a family who had planned to demolish property in the choice estate to execute a Supreme Court judgment.
