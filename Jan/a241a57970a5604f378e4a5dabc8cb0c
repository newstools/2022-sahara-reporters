Director-General of Voice of Nigeria, Osita Okechukwu, has been detained by Economic and Financial Crimes Commission over a case of conspiracy, abuse of office and misappropriation of public funds to the tune of N1.3billion. Osita arrived at the EFCC headquarters in Abuja at about 1:30pm to honour an invitation but was detained and interrogated.  A source disclosed that “Osita Okechukwu, an All Progressives Congress chieftain, was consequently detained and interrogated about his alleged involvement in the fraud. He is still in custody as we speak.” EFCC spokesperson, Wilson Uwujaren, confirmed his invitation but declined to provide further details. Okechukwu had in November asked President Muhammadu Buhari to release Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra. Okechukwu also asked IPOB to support a candidate of Igbo extraction in the 2023 presidential election.
