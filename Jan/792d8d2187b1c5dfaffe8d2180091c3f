A magistrate court in Kano has remanded Abdulmalik Tanko and two other suspects at a correctional centre over the alleged gruesome murder of a five-year-old pupil, Hanifa Abubakar.  On Monday, the police in Kano arraigned the three suspects before Chief Magistrate Muhammad Jibir for alleged criminal conspiracy, kidnapping, concealing/keeping in confinement a kidnapped person and culpable homicide.  Tanko, who is the proprietor of Noble Kids School, Kwanan Dakata in Kano where Hanifa was a pupil, had earlier confessed to kidnapping and subsequently killing the minor with rat poison.  However, the accused persons were not represented in court by lawyers, and immediately after the charges were read to them, the court ordered their remand at the Kano Correctional Centre.
