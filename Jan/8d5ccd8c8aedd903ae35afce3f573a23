Four students of the University of Port Harcourt, who were kidnapped last weekend, have regained their freedom. The students were returning from the Ahoada area of Rivers State before their abductors struck and whisked them away.  They, however, escaped from the kidnappers on Wednesday morning when a team of security operatives invaded the hideout with heavy firepower and engaged the abductors. Spokesperson for the university, Sam Kpenu, while confirming the release of the four victims, disclosed that they had since reunited with their families. Kpenu noted that the students had as part of their academic exercise gone to the Orashi area (Ahoada) to conduct vegetation sampling for their final year projects when they were seized by the kidnappers. He said, “Four students of the University of Port Harcourt who were kidnapped last weekend have been released and reunited with their families. “Gbaa Nenubari, Asumbo Elizabeth, Eze Chimezie, and Onosigho Augustine were abducted on their way from the Orashi River where they had gone for a vegetation sampling for their final year project and postgraduate research work.” Kpenu hinted that Vice Chancellor of the university, Prof Owunari Georgewill, received the four students in his office after their release. Prof Georgewill urged all staff and students to be security conscious at all times, adding that the school’s management will always ensure their safety and well-being.
