A Senior Advocate of Nigeria and founder, Afe Babalola University, Ado Ekiti, Aare Afe Babalola, has said Nigeria would collapse if the 2023 general elections was conducted under the present 1999 constitution. According to him, it is imperative that the National Assembly pass a resolution adopting the 1960 constitution before the next general elections, adding that this will help to avert the collapse of the country in view of the challenges created by the current constitution.  He made this known in Ado Ekiti during a ceremony to commemorate the 12th anniversary of the establishment of ABUAD. He said, “We must avoid recycling the old failed leaders in the governance of this country. Any mistake of electing a new set of leaders under the present constitution will ruin Nigeria completely. “The simple way out is for the National Assembly to pass a resolution adopting the 1960/1963 constitution with necessary amendments such as having in place six regions and a one-house parliament.” He further faulted the National Assembly over increasing the creation of universities across the country, saying the development had usurped the power of the National Universities Commission as prescribed by law on the establishment of institutions. Babalola, who said the development would have adverse effects on the nation’s education sector, called on the Ministry of Education and the NUC “to exercise their powers to checkmate this in the interest of quality education in the country”. He added, “Every attempt must be made by all stakeholders to put a lid on the establishment of political universities that hardly survive those who put them in place after they are out of power, otherwise there will be a crash in the quality of private universities.”
