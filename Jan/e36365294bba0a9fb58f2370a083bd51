President Muhammadu Buhari has been urged by residents of communities in Kaduna State ravaged by banditry to visit their communities and see their present living conditions.  President Buhari is scheduled to embark on a two-day state visit to Kaduna on January 20 and 21, 2022. President Buhari During the visit, the President will inaugurate some of the infrastructural projects executed by Governor Nasir el-Rufai.  Some communities including Birnin Gwari, Chikun, Igabi and Giwa local government areas of Kaduna State have been overrun by terrorists.  Many people have reportedly abandoned their communities for fear of being killed or abducted by armed men.  According to Daily Trust, a mother of six, Saratu Iliyasu, who had fled Marke II in Giwa LGA and was now taking refuge in Zaria, appealed to the President to visit the area in order to understand their sufferings.  “This is an opportunity for him to see things for himself.  “He doesn’t have to rely on what the security reports are saying or what the soldier are telling him, he needs to see things for himself,” she said.  Also, a community leader in Fatika district of Giwa LGA asserted that the President owed them a visit as people in the state had voted massively for him in 2015 and 2019.  “We want him to come and see the situation of his people, if at all we are his people and I assure you he will shed tears.  “When Governor Nasir el-Rufai visited us in December after an attack, he couldn’t help it but to shed tears when he saw our condition,” he said.
