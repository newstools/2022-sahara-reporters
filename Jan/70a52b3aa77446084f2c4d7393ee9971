The Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association (MACBAN) says it preferred the national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and former Lagos Governor, Bola Tinubu as President in 2023. MACBAN disclosed this on Sunday after a meeting at the Agricultural and Rural Management Training Institute, Abuja.  The meeting drew Fulani leaders from the 36 states and the FCT Abuja. “We are also scanning the people showing interest in the presidential seat with Bola Tinubu leading because he was the one that intervened in our matter while he was governor of Lagos, State and when we had a crisis in Benue,” Ya’u Haruna, the convener of the meeting and one-time chairman of the Jigawa chapter of MACBAN said. “Tinubu came all the way, got us on a round table and reconciled us, so, someone who could do this at that time, we believe can do more when he is at the helm of affairs.” He added that many Fulani in Nigeria are seen as criminals. “We are not in any way saying there are no criminals that engage in kidnapping, cattle rustling, banditry and other crimes. But it must also be known that a larger percentage of our people live peacefully and conduct their legitimate businesses,” Haruna said.
