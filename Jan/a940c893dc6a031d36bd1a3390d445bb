Chief Ayo Adebanjo, the leader of pan Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, has said no presidential candidate in the 2023 elections has its support. He was reacting to a declaration by former Lagos Governor, Bola Tinubu, stating he had informed President Muhammadu Buhari of his intentions to contest in the forthcoming elections. Tinubu in London A statement accredited to the Secretary-General of the group, Bayo Aina, had said Tinubu's declaration was a good development. The group had further said Afenifere would work with traditional, religious leaders, and other major stakeholders to ensure that the South-West remained unmatched in 2023. But in his reactions, Adebanjo said while the national leader of the All Progressives Congress Tinubu, had the right to contest the 2023 presidential election, the group would never queue behind any candidate. He further insisted on restructuring the country stressing that the present constitution must be changed before the coming elections. He said, “Your man has every right to contest the election, he is not disabled, so what is the big deal about that? We are not contending who is the President now because we don’t believe in the constitution that we have. Until that constitution is changed, then we will talk about where the President will be. “We have no candidate now until that constitution is changed because I don’t want to go on an uncharted sea that is the implication now. You must believe in the constitution before you say I want to be a part of it. I am not going to be part of the constitution or election that operates a military constitution. That’s the bone of contention and which President Buhari himself has not disputed. The constitution we have is a military one.”
