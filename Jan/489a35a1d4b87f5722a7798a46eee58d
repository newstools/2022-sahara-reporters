The Ogun State House of Assembly, Olakunle Oluomo, has asked the State High Court to stop the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) from questioning them over alleged financial misappropriation, forgery and money laundering. In a letter dated January 05, 2022 with a reference No: CR:3000/EFCC/LS/CMU/OG1/VOL.1/004, the EFCC had asked the Speaker to report to its office along with the Accountant and Director of Finance and Account for questioning.  A source told SaharaReporters on Friday that Oluomo who was banking on the support of Governor Dapo Abiodun and other members had approached the state High Court to obtain an injunction that would stop the EFCC from pursuing the case. “The governor has reached out to the power-that-be in Abuja and the EFCC investigation will fizzle out,” a source had earlier told SaharaReporters. Meanwhile, the EFCC letter to the Ogun Assembly Speaker had read, “The commission’s letter with reference number CR, 3000/EFCC/LS/CMU/OG1/VOL.3/165 dated 9th December 2021 and your response of 13th December 2021 on the above subject, refer. “In view of the above, you are kindly requested to report along with the accountant and Director of Finance and Account for the pending interview with the undersigned through the Head, Chairman’s monitoring Unit as follow.”
