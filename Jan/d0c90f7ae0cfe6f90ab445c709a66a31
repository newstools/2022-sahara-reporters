Police operatives in Plateau State have arrested a young man identified as Moses Okon, who is suspected to have killed Jennifer Anthony, a 300-level female student of the University of Jos. Okon was suspected to have killed the young lady in a hotel in Jos, capital of Plateau, for ritual purpose. File photo used to illustrate story. Jenifer was reportedly lured into a hotel by Okon last week and killed her in a very barbaric manner. Okon was also known as a student of Zoology Department in the University of Jos. The suspect was said to have drugged the lady and used various instruments to remove her eyes and other vital parts of her body before he ran away from the hotel after the dastardly act. After parading the suspect, Plateau State Commissioner of Police, Batholomew Onyeka, disclosed that the suspected killer of Anthony whose lifeless body was found mutilated on a New Year Day at Domus Pacis Guest House, Jos, by a man named Moses Oko, has been apprehended. “The man aged 20 years, suspected to be her boyfriend fled after committing the crime, the command in a bid to arrest the perpetrator launched an aggressive manhunt on the suspect and tactically trailed him to Benue State where he was arrested by hawked-eye police operatives of the command.” He added that the suspect will be arraigned in court as soon as investigation was completed, urging members of the public, who still have more information on how the incident happened, to contact the command.
