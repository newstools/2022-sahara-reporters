Bandits on Monday evening invaded Gbagyi Village on the outskirts of Kaduna State, abducting many people in the process. This was made known in a Twitter post by Senator Shehu Sani, who formerly represented Kaduna Central at the National Assembly. File photo used to illustrate story. He said, “Bandits stormed the Gbagyi villa community in the outskirts of Kaduna yesternight and kidnapped a number of people. "Locals said the response of soldiers helped in preventing mass abduction.This is the plight of our people everyday.” This comes barely a week after bandits attacked Sabon Birnin Birnin Village in Igabi Local Government Area of Kaduna State, leaving seven members of the same family dead. The incident has, however, caused a mass exodus of residents from the area due to fear of being attacked or killed by marauding bandits, a community leader, Bello Musa, said. He appealed to government to deploy more troops to Igabi and other troubled zones in Kaduna State in order to protect the people from further attacks.
