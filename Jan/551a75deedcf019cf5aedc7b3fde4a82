No fewer than five persons have been reportedly killed as fresh crisis ensued when Fulani herdsmen attack farmers in the Imeko-Afon Local Government Area of Ogun State. It was learnt the Fulani herdsmen and some Ohori farmers engaged one another in a clash at Idofa village, leading to loss of lives and property worth millions of Naira.  According to Daily Post, the residents of Aworo community in the Yewa North Local Government chased the herdsmen from their village to Idofa in Imeko, killing three of them and their cows. Aworo people had accused the Fulani of destroying their farms and water sources through open grazing of cows, a practice the Ogun State government had banned. A community leader who spoke on the condition of anonymity said there was a reprisal attack on Thursday after the Aworo people killed the three herdsmen in Idofa. He said the retaliation led to the death of two Yorubas, one of whom was burnt beyond recognition. Houses, four maize barns, motorcycles and other valuables were reportedly set ablaze by the attackers. “The Aworo people chased the herdsmen from Yewa North to Idofa in Imeko.
