The terrorists reportedly stormed the market on motorcycles, armed with AK-47 rifles and shot sporadically.The traders however scampered for safety giving the terrorists an avenue to loot in the market and steal valuables, while some traders were injured.The terrorists, also, at about 2pm today, went to Sabon Gari in Ruma, where they carted away some livestock ready for the Jibiya market.According to AIT live, the dare-devil terrorists further pounced on a commercial car and opened fire on the vehicle which was conveying traders from Batsari to Jibiya Local Government Area, as the driver refused to stop.The driver was shot in the hand, while four other passengers were injured, and are currently receiving treatment at the hospital.Meanwhile, a security expert said the attacks were subdued due to the timely intervention of the security agencies, who are also in the area, maintaining law and order.Batsari is among the 13 frontline local government areas, bedevilled by the activities of terrorists, who kidnap, rustle cattle and rape.
