Protesting youths have stormed the Kano Magistrate’s court premises in Nomansland, where the former Commissioner of Works, Muazu Magaji, is being arraigned. The youth bearing placards were chanting, “Free Mu’azu Magaji”, as they demanded justice for the embattled former commissioner. Magaji was arraigned before Justice Aminu Gabari on a four-count charge.The charge, according to the police First Information Report, (FIR) bothers on defamation of character, injurious falsehood and others.However, protesters gathered in numbers, raising placard and chanting ‘free Mu’azu Magaji.“We are not here to disrupt peace; we are here to demand justice for Jagora. We want the court to do justice to our leader, Mu’azu Magaji,” said one of the protesters.However, another group of protesters, who were identified as students, said they wanted justice for Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje.They said Magaji had been inciting the public against Ganduje and causing public unrest.“All we want is justice for our governor; we want him to reap what he has been doing. A governor is not something to play with but he has been attacking the governor on social media,” Aminu Muhammad one of the protesters, lamented.Meanwhile, the judge told the lawyers he could not proceed with the case until the youth vacated the court premises.Counsel to Magaji, Garzali Ahmad, pleaded with the protesters to vacate the place and allow the proceedings to hold.“The judge said he cannot proceed with the case until the crowd leaves. That’s I why I’m pleading with you to please leave this place otherwise the person you want you are demanding justice for will not be here,” he said.As of the time of filing this report, journalists, security personnel, lawyers and other people were stranded at the court premises not knowing whether the case would hold or not.
