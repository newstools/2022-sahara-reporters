No fewer than five persons have been reportedly killed by bandits in Jauro Manu village in the Gassol Local Government Area of Taraba State. Residents are said to be living in tension as the bandits reportedly threatened to attack more communities in the area.  According to Punch, the gunmen, numbering about six invaded the Jauro Manu community and killed one Musa Iramiya, a businessman and farmer at about 4:30 pm on New Year’s Day before proceeding to attack other residents, leaving at least five persons dead. The community had not been attacked until the New Year, adding that the fresh threat by the bandits had sent fears to the community as residents were contemplating fleeing the community to Mutum-Biyu, the local government headquarters. “There is tension and confusion in the community. Residents are now living in fear. Many residents are considering leaving the community to Mutum-Biyu for fear of attacks. But I want to appeal to the security agencies to increase surveillance in the area,” a resident pleaded. Meanwhile, the Taraba State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Usman Abdullahi, noted that he was yet to get a brief from the Divisional Police Officer of the area.
