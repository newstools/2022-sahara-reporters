President Muhammadu Buhari has called for a heightened military presence in Niger State following cases of killings and kidnappings in the state. The President urged the military to respond “robustly” to cases of killings and kidnappings in the state.  This was disclosed in a statement by Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu. According to Shehu, President Buhari as Commander-in-Chief of the nation’s armed forces, had set the ball rolling for a major military operation in Niger State, which had faced continued attacks on its communities by bandits and remnants of Boko Haram terrorists fleeing theatres of war in the North-Western and North-Wastern parts of the country. In his message to the government and people of Niger State, President Buhari said, “I would like to express sincere sympathies to the government and people of the state following recent security incidents. “The Federal Government is willing to strengthen support and cooperation with all the states. I believe that with the full cooperation of the citizens, we will surely overcome this problem.” On Tuesday, at least 13 people were confirmed killed in an attack by suspected bandits in the Shiroro Local Government Area of the state. Police spokesperson in the state, Wasiu Abiodun, said the assailants attacked villagers, who were harvesting crops on their farm in Nakundna under Shiroro council area. A statement by Governor Abubakar Bello, however, indicated that the attack spread to another village called Wurukuchi. Governor Bello in a statement by his media aide, Mary Noel-Berje, described the attacks as insane and unacceptable.
