Operatives of the Philippines’ National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) have arrested two Nigerians and three others for allegedly masterminding the so-called “Mark Nagoyo” bank hacking that affected more than 700 clients of BDO Unibank. The NBI on Friday said the five suspects were arrested in two different entrapment operations conducted by operatives of the NBI-Cybercrime Division in Pampanga.   The two Nigerians—Ifesinachi Fountain Anaekwe also known as “Daddy Champ,” and Chukwumeka Peter Nwadi—were apprehended on Tuesday in Mabalacat, Pampanga, a province in capital city Manila. The other suspects identified as Jherom Taupa, Ronelyn Panaligan, and Clay Revillosa were also arrested in Pampanga. The NBI said Taupa was the allegedly the brains behind the operation while Panaligan and Clay Revillosa were involved in the BDO hacking as web developers and downloaders. According to the NBI, the suspects were involved in the BDO hacking last December where more than 700 of BDO’s clients lost funds in their accounts. The NBI said the suspects were able to access bank accounts and made the fund transfers while supposedly bypassing the One-Time-Pin requirement. The email confirmations for the bulk of the illegal transfers showed that they were made by a certain “Mark D. Nagoyo.” It also happened that the surname “nagoyo” could be loosely translated as “swindled” in Tagalog, national language of The Philippines.
