The Islamic State-backed faction of Boko Haram, the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), formerly known as Jamā'at Ahl as-Sunnah lid-Da'wah wa'l-Jihād, has attacked Wultihiya, a town in Borno State. Wultihiya, a predominantly Christian community, is located in the Askira Uba Local Government Area of the state.  SaharaReporters learnt that the gunmen also burnt down the community’s church, some houses and two cars. The attack, which occurred on Thursday was not repelled, residents told SaharaReporters. Residents who had retired into their homes were forced to flee into the bushes as the gunmen stormed the village, shooting sporadically.  Since the death of JAS leader, Abubakar Shekau, ISWAP has been consolidating its grip in locations around Lake Chad. Just recently, it appointed Wali Sani Shuwaram, a 45-year-old as the new Leader (Wali) of ISWAP in Lake Chad. The sect’s membership has swollen with the defection of hundreds of Boko Haram fighters under Shekau. The Nigerian Army has repeatedly claimed that insurgency had been largely defeated and frequently underplays any losses. The terror group has caused over 100,000 deaths and displaced millions of individuals mainly in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe States.
