Traders and buyers are presently going about their usual activities at the Orie Ugba market in Umuahia, the Abia State capital, as the trial of Nnamdi Kanu, resumes in Abuja. Despite the sit-at-home directive by the Indigenous People of Biafra led by Kanu to boycott economic activities, business is ongoing at the market.  The traders opened their shops and stalls to buy and sell without frustration or molestation. Abia is the home state of Kanu, the IPOB leader. Although schools and banks were closed, some vehicles still ply the roads, according to the reports and video clips from BBC News Pidgin on Tuesday morning. Recall that IPOB has issued directive that there would be sit-at-home in all five states of the South-East region today. IPOB spokesperson, Emma Powerful, last week, urged residents and supporters of Kanu to give him solidarity by shunning business activities. Powerful, however, reiterated that the sit-at-home should not be enforced, and people should go about their businesses on Wednesday and Thursday.
