The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control has said that 29 people tested positive for Coronavirus on Saturday. The figure is the country’s lowest single-day count since November 19, 2021 when 23 cases were reported.  In its latest update, NCDC said the positive cases of Coronavirus came from three states. A breakdown of new cases showed that Lagos — Nigeria’s pandemic epicentre — recorded the highest number of new infections with 27 new positive samples, followed by Kano and Rivers with one each. According to the agency, 40 persons recovered from the infection while 225,946 people have now been discharged. No death figure was recorded from COVID-19 complications, leaving the death toll at 3,124. Since the index case in February 2020, a total of 251,959 Coronavirus infections have been confirmed across Nigeria — out of which 22,889 are active cases. On Saturday, the Lagos government said the consistent decrease in COVID-19 cases indicates the end of the pandemic’s fourth wave in the state. Giving a situation update via Twitter, Akin Abayomi, the state's Commissioner for Health, said there was a reduction in positivity rates — from 29.3 percent recorded on December 21, 2021, to 1.9 percent as of January 20, 2022.
