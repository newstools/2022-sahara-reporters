Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has said that part of Nigeria's problem was President Muhammadu Buhari, who gives approvals without reading documents. Wike stated this on Saturday while answering questions from journalists when he paid a visit to his Bauchi State counterpart, Bala Mohammed.  Wike also faulted the President for signing the 2022 budget despite his complaint about some “worrisome changes”. He opined that what Nigeria needed to effectively work was a President, who is healthy, strongand young. He said, “What Nigeria requires now is leadership, if you have responsible leadership, most of the problems Nigeria is facing will be solved. “And then, you have a President who commissions projects virtually. Why will I commission a project virtually? Something you’ve not seen with your eyes, yet, you are commissioning. “You saw a President that said that this budget cannot be implemented but he went ahead and signed it. Something you know will not help the country, he couldn’t tell the National Assembly that he won’t sign it, and you signed it. “I won’t sign, if I know it is not going to help, it will not help the economy, it is inflated, I’ll tell the National Assembly that I won’t sign it.”
