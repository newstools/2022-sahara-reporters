Though it acknowledged that the security challenges confronting Nigeria were worsening, the US urged the government and the military to combat insecurity with regards to human rights of Nigerian citizens.The Press Attache, US Embassy, Jeanne Clark, said these on Thursday, in reaction to a statement by the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, that the Nigerian government has gotten an approval to deploy the jet fighters which were acquired from the US, against bandits who had just been designated as terrorists.The military had been reluctant to engage the usage of the aircraft outside the North-East because of the requirements attached to the sale of the aircraft which centered on human rights.But speaking as a guest on the NTA Good Morning Nigeria programme, on Tuesday, Malami said that the coast had become clear to deploy the Super Tucano aircraft against bandits in the North-West and North-Central, following the court order declaring them as terrorists.Clark in her statement said the US government was, however, pleased that the Nigerian Air Force had used the A-29 Super Tucano successfully against Boko Haram and the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP).She stated, “We are pleased the Nigerian Air Force has used the A-29 Super Tucanos successfully against Boko Haram and ISIS-WA. The sale of the A-29 Super Tucanos is governed by the US Arms Export Control Act, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other applicable statutes, and their use must conform with international norms as articulated in the United Nations Charter.“The AECA applies to sales to all of our allies and partners and it generally cautions against uses that encroach on traditional law enforcement roles. We are proud to partner with the government of Nigeria towards shared goals.”
