Abubakar Abdulsalam, father of the kidnapped and murdered Kano pupil, Hanifa Abubakar, has tearfully narrated how his daughter was gruesomely murdered by her teacher and proprietor, Abdulmalik Mohammad Tanko, in Kano State. Five-year-old Abubakar was reportedly abducted by her teacher on December 4, 2021 and murdered two weeks later.  Her grave was discovered days ago in the same school where she attended for about two terms, some seven months ago. On Thursday, the police exhumed the mutilated body of the minor buried within the school premises where she previously attended. Speaking to SaharaReporters, Abdulsalam said the news of his daughter's demise came to the family as a rude shock, leading to the hospitalisation of his wife.

He described his daughter as a highly spirited girl, full of life and likeable by all who have met her. "I wonder why anyone would want to harm her", he added. "Hanifa was distinguished among her peers within the neighbourhood; she was a brilliant girl and loves her father so much.
