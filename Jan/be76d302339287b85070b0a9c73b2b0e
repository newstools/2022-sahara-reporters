Nigerians have expressed mixed reactions over the Muhammadu Buhari’s government to officially designate bandits as terrorists, with many saying it is a political gimmick ahead of the 2023 general elections. SaharaReporters had on Wednesday reported that the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), gazetted a court judgment that ordered the government to declare bandits as terrorists.  This is after several weeks of foot-dragging despite a ruling by Justice Taiwo Taiwo of the Federal High Court in Abuja on November 25, 2021, granting an ex parte application by the Federal Government for Yan Bindiga (Hausa word for gunmen) and Yan Ta’adda (Hausa word for terrorists) to be declared as terrorists. The administration of President Muhammadu Buhari delayed for over a month until the official declaration yesterday. However, Nigerians have not shown excitement over this news as some saw the delayed declaration as a strategy by the ruling party to maintain its hold in the forthcoming 2023 elections. Some Nigerians queried why the Nigerian government had refused to declare the Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore as terrorists alongside the new designation given to bandits.
