Human rights’ activist, Omoyele Sowore, has described the late Ernest Shonekan as a traitor and not a leader as many claimed he was.Shonekan reportedly died on Tuesday in Lagos State at the age of 85, generating reactions from the leaders and citizenry. Reacting, Sowore said Shonekan was not a leader but a traitor who betrayed Chief Moshood Kashimawo Abiola and a betrayer of Nigeria’s quest for genuine democracy before and during the June 12 1993 era.He also said Shonekan was not an interim leader as stated in many news outlets, clarifying that the concept of “Interim National Government” was already nullified by a Lagos High Court also in 1993.Sowore urged Nigerians to hold Nigerian leaders accountable both when alive and dead.He wrote, “When I learned of the death of Chief Ernest Shonekan today at the age of 85, I could not hold my anger at the reporting (including at Sahara Reporters) that claimed he was a “Nigerian leader.”“Truth is that Chief Shonekan wasn’t a leader, he was a traitor who betrayed Chief Moshood Kashimawo Abiola and a betrayer of Nigeria’s quest for genuine democracy before and during the June 12, 1993, era.
