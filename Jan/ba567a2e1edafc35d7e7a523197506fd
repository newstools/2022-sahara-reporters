Spokesperson for the Zamfara State Police Command, Mohammed Shehu, led the suspects to court. “On December 28th last year, the corpse of one Ahmad Yakubu nine year old was found in an uncompleted building at Barakallahu area in Gusau, with its two hands and legs tied with rag, head covered with polyethene bag and some of the human parts missing. “Then, on January 4, 2022, police detectives acted on intelligence reports and arrested a suspect by name Aminu Baba and four others in connection with the killing,” the police said After hearing the case for almost two hours, the suspects pleaded not guilty to the charges The presiding judge, Sa’adu Gurbinbaure, adjourned the case to February 8 for hearing. This decision, however, didn’t go down well with the parents and relations of the victim as they protested outside the court. Mother of the deceased, Jamila Abdulrahaman, said the boy, who facilitated the abduction of her son, was their house boy. She asked the court to ensure justice was done to serve as deterrent to others.
