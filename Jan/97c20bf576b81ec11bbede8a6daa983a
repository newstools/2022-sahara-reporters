The Coalition of Northern Groups has declared that the only thing that could solve the agitations of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra was to conduct a referendum. Spokesperson for the group, Abdul-Azeez Suleiman, said this while explaining that the group was not surprised that IPOB banned the singing of national anthem in Igboland and transportation of cows to the South-East Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG). He maintained that they foresaw the scenario long ago and in 2017 took bold and necessary steps to address Nigeria on the unfolding developments. He said, "The warning we issued in 2017 was deliberately distorted instead of treating it as a warning from history which repeats itself. "Today everyone can see that the agitations and disturbances that have been ongoing ceaselessly since around 2015 are systematically being manipulated towards rendering the country practically ungovernable and ushering in anarchy and instability that could portend the breakup of the country. "We at the CNG are convinced beyond doubt that the resurgence of separatist agitations especially by IPOB and its ilk in the South-East represent a much wider conspiracy to divide Nigeria and the current regime of boycotts announced by IPOB aims to bring the North down on its knees by economic incapacitation and political balkanisation. "The specific targeting of the North by the ban that inadvertently exposes Northerners to imminent attacks and irreverent treatment is aimed at causing inter-regional crisis possibly leading to a civil war or general unrest. "The economy and commercial health of both sides would suffer the consequences of the boycott."
