Ibrahim Na’iddah, lawmaker representing Gusau II Constituency in the Zamfara House of Assembly, is dead. This was contained in a statement issued in Gusau on Saturday by the spokesperson for the Assembly, Mustafa Jafaru-Kaura.  Jafaru-Kaura said the lawmaker died on Saturday after a “protracted illness”. Na’iddah was said to have died at the Federal Medical Centre, Gusau, the Zamfara capital. His death came barely six months after Ibrahim Ahmad representing Shinkafi Constituency was killed by armed bandits while on his way to Kano State. With the recent development, the state Assembly now has two vacant seats.
