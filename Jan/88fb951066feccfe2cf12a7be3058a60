The resignation comes on the heels of the controversy surrounding the planned convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC).From media reports, Lukman had consistently warned against the further delay of the National Convention noting that any of such delay may lead to the party’s political grave.In a statement on Friday, he had argued the Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) should be blamed for the tension generated by the continued delay in the conduct of the party’s national convention.Meanwhile, some days ago, the Progressives Youth Council of the All Progressives Congress (APC) called for sack of the Director-General over alleged anti-party activities.Members of the group claimed Lukman had shown that he is a mole in the ruling party with a mission to undermine it and ultimately hand advantage to the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in 2023.The APC-PYC said that Lukman, in recent time, sponsored series of protests and media propaganda against the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) amid other allegations.
