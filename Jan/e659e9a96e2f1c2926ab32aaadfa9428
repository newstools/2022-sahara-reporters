A former National Publicity Secretary of the Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chuks Ibegbu, has advised the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu and Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, not to run for President during the 2023 general elections. Ibegbu said Tinubu and Atiku should drop their ambitions due to their age.  He added that Atiku, Tinubu and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo should rather pick a credible presidential candidate from the South-East noting that the rigorous nature of the Presidency wouldn’t allow the likes of Tinubu and Atiku to perform optimally at their age. Ibegbu’s comment came after Tinubu disclosed that he had informed President Muhammadu Buhari of his intention to run for the presidency in 2023. According to Daily Post, Ibegbu said, “I’m surprised that people like Tinubu have the audacity to come out, and I’m amazed that our Vice President, whom I see as a man of God, is also aspiring.

I’ve Told Buhari About My 2023 Presidential Ambition – Tinubu
0 Comments
1 Day Ago “The other time the President complained that age is telling on him, that if he works for some hours, he becomes exhausted. Should a very complex nation like Nigeria be ruled by such people that age is not on their side? Nigeria is a very complex nation, and this country can give a young man a headache. “Age is a factor in ruling a complex nation like Nigeria because you will be thinking of so many things, you will be thinking of your family, constituency, the entire country with more than 300 ethnic nationalities, you are thinking about international issues, the economy. Look at Obama; within one year, he grew gray hair. “The Presidency; we need should be a young, dynamic person with the energy to move around. Look at Buhari with all the killings in his state; he can’t move around because age is not on his side. He may be mentally sound, but he’s physically comatose.

Becoming Nigeria's President Has Been My Lifelong Ambition — APC Leader, Tinubu Confesses

23 Hours Ago “Tinubu did his bit in Lagos when he was governor; he was vibrant then, but age is not on his side now. Tinubu is almost 90 years old now; forget about what he is saying about his age. He should be about 80 something but claiming to be 60 something. Age is not on his side now. “So, why can’t they stay behind and advise younger people from the Southeast? I’m challenging Tinubu and Atiku to sit together and help to look for a credible presidential candidate from the Southeast, whether in APC, PDP, or APGA. Both of them should have a meeting with Osinbajo to help look for a credible, nice young candidate from the Southeast. “Atiku has a lot of financial war chests that he can use to support these people; let him bring out the money and support somebody who will make Nigeria a better place. If they don’t become President, they won’t die. Awolowo would have been the best President we ever had if things had gone well, he handled Western Nigeria very well, and he should have handled the country very well. “My advice to Tinubu and Atiku is to help midwife a young visionary and dynamic person from the Southeast to succeed Buhari.”
