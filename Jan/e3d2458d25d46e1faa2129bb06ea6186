The National Association of Nigerian Students, Zone C, has revealed the plans of the management of the University of Jos to increase the school's accommodation fees. The students body condemned the action, stating that the school authorities was plotting to bring unnecessary pains on the students. Hostel It lamented that the hostels have not experienced any renovation lately, adding that there was no justification for the purported increment. NANS said this in a statement by its Zone C spokesperson, Nanzing Nanla Nanzing, on Friday. It reads, "Arising from an emergency stakeholders meeting resolves as thus: "We reject in totality the said resolution between the student union committee with the university management on the proposed hike in accommodation fees and still insist on zero percent increment. "It is so disheartening that despite the obvious economic hardship being witness in the entire nation, students are still subject to this kind of unnecessary pains. "It is also unfortunate that the said increment is coming when there hasn't been any addition, renovation or reconstruction of the existing hostel structures, so the big question is, what is the increment for? "Based on a very popular demands from majority of Nigerian students on campus, after rigorous consultation across board, the general consensus is that there should be no increment for now until there is a significant upgrading and modernization of the exiting structures in the nearest future. "Therefore, the management of the University of Jos are advised on the interest of the majority of the students and general public to kindly reverse it position with immediate effect. "Meanwhile, the National leadership of NANS, and all it's affiliate organs and structures have been placed on red alert for necessary mobilization to relocate it's headquarters to University of Jos, should management still insist of going ahead with their unpopular plans."
