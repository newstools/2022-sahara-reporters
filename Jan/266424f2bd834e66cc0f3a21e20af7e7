The Bolgatanga District Court in Ghana has granted bail to 18 Nigerian ladies who were earlier arrested over prostitution allegations. Also, the police arrested three Ghanaians believed to have been promoting the business and housing the prostitutes.  The ladies were reportedly arrested at Midnight Drinking Spot (Akolbila Bar) in Atulibabisi, a suburb of Bolgatanga on January 6, 2022, and charged with illegal entry into the neighbouring country without a permit and also for engaging in prostitution for a living. The owners and managers of the Midnight Drinking Spot, Akolbila, and Akolbila Aminah were charged with abetment of crime and for keeping a brothel. The third accused, Norbert Anamzoya was charged for promoting the trade of prostitution Meanwhile, the Nigerians were arraigned before the court where they pleaded not guilty but were refused bail by Presiding Judge, H/W Mawukoenya Nutekpor who remanded them for a week. However, on January 13, 2022, they returned to court where their Counsel, Richard Adazabra, argued that the offences brought against the suspects were misdemeanours which did not warrant lengthy periods of remand adding that, granting bail to the suspects will allow for a speedy trial. The court granted bail of GHC10,000 (N661, 340) and GHC6,000 (N396, 804) to the 18 Nigerians and the three Ghanaians. Further hearing has been slated for February 18, 2022.
