President Muhammadu Buhari has arrived the family home of late Head of Interim National Government, Ernest Shonekan, who died on Tuesday at the age of 85. Buhari, who visited Ogun State on Thursday to inaugurate projects by the state government, took time out from his schedule to visit family members of the demised elder statesman in Abeokuta, the capital, to commiserate with his people.  The President had shortly after Shonekan’s death ordered that Nigerian flag to be flown at half mast in honour of the late politician. He had noted that Shonekan demonstrated to all that the love for country and commitment to her development, peace and unity was more than selfish political gains.
