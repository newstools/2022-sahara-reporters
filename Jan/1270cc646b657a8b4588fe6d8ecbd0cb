President Muhammadu Buhari is set to meet with governors of the All Progressive Congress to decide a date for the conduct of the party’s national convention. Chairman of the Northern Governors Forum and governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong, disclosed this while addressing journalists after meeting with Buhari at the Presidential Villa in Abuja on Friday.  It is understood that the development comes due to mounting pressure from the President to ensure the APC does not lose power to the Peoples Democratic Party.  According to Lalong, the meeting holding on Sunday, will centre on the proposed date for the convention. The governor said Buhari’s admonition to the party that it risks losing power to the Peoples Democratic Party was a signal for the party to have a seamless convention so that it will not disintegrate. Lalong added that the governors have assured the President that the convention will hold in February. He said Buhari’s warning is for the party to redouble its effort and do the right thing. Lalong observed that as a political party, the APC was made up of different interests saying, “What matters is that at the end of the day, we will elect our representatives."
