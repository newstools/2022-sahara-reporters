Mixed reactions have trailed a video shared by Nigerian musician, David Adeleke popularly known as Davido, showing a policeman in uniform washing his newly purchased Rolls Royce Cullinan.  The video, which has gone viral, has sparked reactions from Nigerian on social media users, who attributed such to the poor pay of police officers.  Others condemned the officer for doing the cleaning while on uniform.  An Instagram user, hrh_kingdiamond, while reacting to the incident, said, “What a country. What money cannot do doesn't exist.”  Another user, bosalami stated, “Nigeria Police has suffered in this life, there is no way citizens will respect them like this.”  Freakydelgbaskyonasmuffpumpin wrote, “That's a policeman cleaning the car for a civilian. It shouldn't be, at least not on uniform."  Social media in Nigeria went agog in 2021 when Davido shared the news that he splashed millions of naira on a brand new Rolls Royce.  It was initially reported that the car costs N240m but Tunde Ednut, a Nigerian blogger based in the United States, later confirmed that the car was bought for N283m.
