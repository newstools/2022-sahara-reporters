Insurgents from the Islamic State-backed faction of Boko Haram, the Islamic State West Africa Province formerly known as Jamā'at Ahl as-Sunnah lid-Da'wah wa'l-Jihād, are currently attacking Ajiri. 


SaharaReporters Media Ajiri is a community in Mara Local Government Area of Borno State, which is about 52km from Maiduguri, the state capital. A source told SaharaReporters that the insurgents came in several trucks fitted with machine guns on Saturday evening. Meanwhile, troops of the Nigerian Army are currently engaging the armed men in a gun battle, the source added. Since the death of JAS leader, Abubakar Shekau, ISWAP has been consolidating its grip in locations around Lake Chad. Recently, it appointed Wali Sani Shuwaram, a 45-year-old as the new leader (Wali) of ISWAP in Lake Chad. The sect’s membership has swollen with the defection of hundreds of Boko Haram fighters under Shekau. The Nigerian Army has repeatedly claimed that insurgency had been largely defeated and frequently underplays any losses. The terror group has caused over 50,000 deaths and displaced millions of people mainly in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states.
