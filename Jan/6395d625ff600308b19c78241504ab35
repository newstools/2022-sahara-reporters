At least three terrorists have been killed in Kaduna State during military operations in Chikun and Igabi local government areas of the state. This was made known in a statement by Samuel Aruwan, the state's Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs. File photo used to illustrate story. According to the statement, the troops in Maraban Rido general area of Chikun LGA heard sounds of gunfire and immediately responded by mobilising towards the target location in Ungwan Musa. The terrorists had set up an ambush, which the troops fought and cleared aggressively as they approached the scene of the attack. An intense gun duel ensued, leading to the death of one of the outlaws. However, some of them escaped through a back fence with gunshot wounds as confirmed by bloodstains that lined their exit. The troops further pursued the terrorists through their withdrawal route and in the process rescued eight persons, who had initially been taken hostage. The rescued persons are listed as Likita Igah, Nancy Likita, Genesis Likita, Wilson Likita, Mary Kalat, Victor Joel, Simon Musa Ali and Rufus Elisha. In another attack, terrorists had tried to forcefully gain entry into one of the residential buildings at Unguwar Tasha in Birnin Yero general area of Igabi Local Government Area of the state but this was successfully foiled by security forces. One of the bandits was neutralised in the operation. Also, a terror attack was foiled in Hayin Kanwa, Giwa LGA. One of the terrorists was similarly neutralised during the encounter. Reacting to the military report, the state governor, Nasir el-Rufai, commended the troops for their bravery and swift response to the attacks.
