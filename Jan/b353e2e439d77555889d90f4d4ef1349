There is palpable tension in Abia State and the South-East region ahead of the court ruling today (Wednesday) on a suit filed by Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB. Justice Benson Anya of the High Court sitting in Abia State had scheduled Wednesday to deliver judgment on Kanu’s N5billion fundamental human rights suit against the Federal Government.  The suit initiated by Kanu’s Counsel, Aloy Ejimakor, had prayed the court to declare the invasion of the residence of the IPOB leader in Abia State in 2017 as unlawful and an infringement on his constitutional right. Kanu, in the suit, also urged the court to declare his rearrest and torture in Kenya last year as unlawful. The suit, which Ejimakor filed in August 2021, further sought the court to stop the Nigerian government from prosecuting Kanu, mandating the Nigerian government to release the IPOB leader, ordering the Nigerian government to tender an apology to Kanu, among others. While the Southeast, Nigeria, and the world prepare for the court’s judgment, IPOB had relaxed its sit-at-home order on Wednesday. Despite relaxing the sit-at-home, some hoodlums had hijacked and tried to enforce the order across the Southeast. On several occasions, some people suspected to be IPOB members have enforced the sit-at-home order, despite the group’s warning. On Tuesday, some youths suspected to be IPOB members had invaded a Catholic Church in Onitsha, Anambra State. However, Kanu’s Special Counsel, Aloy Ejimakor downplayed the possibility of violence after the ruling. SaharaReporters had on Tuesday reported that was already in Umuahia, the Abia State capital ahead of Kanu’s fundamental human rights ruling. “I'm Umuahia in Abia State ahead of the judgment at the Abia court. I'm to lead other legal team. There is no sit-at-home on Wednesday, 19th January," Ejimakor had said.
