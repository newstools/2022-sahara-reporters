Policemen have again arrested Muaz Magaji, one of the fiercest critics of Kano State governor, Abdullahi Ganduje. According to Daily Nigerian, he was arrested by the police after a live television interview at Trust TV in Utako, Abuja, around 9:15pm. Muazu Magaji Although police was yet to speak on the arrest, a witnesses said that Magaji was chased by the law enforcement agency immediately after leaving the television station. “A few minutes ago something really unfortunate, worrisome and regrettable happened along Ngozi Okonjo Iwela way by TOS Benson Crescent junction. Engr Magaji Muazu was pushed into an accident where his Honda car was pushed off the road and made to hit a street light pole. Although he came out of the car looking unharmed, but all the airbags are out. “Apparently it was a police operation because he was immediately arrested and forcefully taken to the Utako Police Station. As I write this I have been at the scene securing his car and we are now on our way to the police station. His bag and the battery of his car are with me,” said a witness. On January 17, police in Kano invited Magaji to answer questions regarding a petition against him. He, however, sent his lawyers to the command instead of appearing in person, and then filed a fundamental enforcement case against the police. Magaji, a former Commissioner for Works and Infrastructure, was fired by Ganduje over “insensitive comments” over the death of Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, Abba Kyari.
