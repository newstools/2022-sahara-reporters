Anthony Joshua on Monday refuted the reports that he had agreed a £15 million ($20million, 18million euros) deal to step aside from his world heavyweight title re-match with Oleksandr Usyk. Joshua affirmed that he is in control of his own destiny. Sky News It has been recently reported that Joshua was willing to allow Ukraine’s Usyk to fight Tyson Fury in a unification title bout. However, Joshua, while speaking in a Talksport online video posted on Twitter, noted that he had not seen any contract. “You know what’s mad about all these interviews I see? I see certain interviews that quote what I said and I think to myself, ‘I haven’t done no interviews. I’m hearing people saying: ‘AJ accepts £15million to step aside’. I ain’t signed no contract; I ain’t seen no contract. “So as it stands, stop listening to the bullshit until it comes from me. I’m the man in control of my own destiny; I’m the man that handles my business.” It was reported in December 2021 that Anthony Joshua and Oleksandr Usyk would renew hostilities after an “opportunity” for an undisputed title fight with Tyson Fury vanished. WBC heavyweight champion Fury was ordered by the governing body to begin negotiations for a fight against Dillian Whyte, who has been officially named as his mandatory challenger. Joshua triggered his option for a rematch shortly after losing the IBF, WBA and WBO titles to Usyk. But Usyk's team believed Joshua "could consider stepping aside", leaving the Ukrainian to decide every major title in the division with Fury.
