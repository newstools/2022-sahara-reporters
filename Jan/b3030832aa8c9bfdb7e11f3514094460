9 Hours Ago “ISWAP are more equipped, sophisticated, intelligent and dangerous as they grow from strength to strength. “ISWAP are collecting taxes along major roads in Damboa and other axis in southern Borno. It is very unfortunate. “But the good news is that about 11 local Government areas of Gwoza, Bama, Marte, Monguno, Kaga, Gubio, Mafa, Dikwa, Ngala and host of others are becoming more peaceful than before, and this could be attributed to about 20,000 surrendered members of Boko Haram who are now in our custody. "I want to use this opportunity to solicit for prayers from all and sundry for total restoration of peace not only in Borno State, but the country as a whole.”
