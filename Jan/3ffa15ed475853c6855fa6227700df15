The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has stopped all unvaccinated workers and visitors from gaining access into its premises. As of 8am on Monday, many of the workers and visitors who have been informed of their inability to access the premises were seen at the gate, grumbling and pleading.  Recall that last week, the administration issued a memo advising staff to get a jab of the COVID-19 vaccines to avoid the latest development. The Senior Special Assistant on Monitoring, Inspection and Enforcement to the FCT Minister, Ikharo Attah, who heads the surveillance team, vowed the enforcement will be sustained to ensure maximum compliance.
