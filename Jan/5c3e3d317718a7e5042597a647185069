A Federal High Court in Lagos on Monday convicted popular skit maker, Joshua Sunday also known as ‘D General’, and Caleb William, a cinematographer, of drug trafficking.  The two young men were dragged to court by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency.  Delivering judgment, Justice Daniel Osiagor held that the volume of substance was minimal and would rather convict the defendants and caution them, rather than sentence them.  The court consequently convicted the defendants and cautioned them to “go and sin no more”.  Both defendants, 22, were charged with three counts of trafficking Tramadol and Cannabis Sativa, to which they both pleaded guilty.  After their pleas, the prosecutor, Jeremiah Aernan, reviewed the facts of the case and tendered evidence before the court through an NDLEA exhibit keeper, Lucky Oghaifu.  Among the evidence tendered include statements of the defendants, drug analysis form, certificate of test analysis, request for scientific aid form, packaging of substance form among others.  The prosecutor said the offence contravenes the provision of Section 11(c) of the NDLEA Act, Cap N30, Laws of the Federation, 2004.  In response, the defence counsel, Lilian Omotunde, urged the court to consider other options besides sentencing the defendants, on the grounds that the defendants were still at their prime and could still be useful to society.  During interrogation by the court, the defendants told the court that they had never tasted drugs.  They told the court that the substances were used as props for their comedy skit, which they were in the process of shooting before their arrest.
