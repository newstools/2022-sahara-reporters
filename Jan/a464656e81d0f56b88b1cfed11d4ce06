The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has suspended Burkina Faso following a coup, but will not impose other sanctions for the time being, a participant at a virtual summit told AFP on Friday.ECOWAS is also calling for the new junta to release ousted president Roch Marc Christian Kabore and other officials detained during Monday’s coup, the source said. The bloc will hold another summit in Accra on February 3, he added.The summit, which lasted around three hours, also decided to send a mission of ECOWAS chiefs of staff to Ouagadougou, the Burkinabe capital, on Saturday.This will be followed on Monday by ministerial-level envoys from the bloc, the source said.Kabore, 64, was elected in 2015 following a popular revolt that forced out strongman Blaise Compaore.He was re-elected in 2020, but the following year faced a wave of anger over the mounting toll from a jihadist insurgency that swept in from neighbouring Mali.
