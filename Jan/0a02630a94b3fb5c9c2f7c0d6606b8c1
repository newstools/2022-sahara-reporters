A Nigerian Air Force personnel, Mohammed Usman, has been accused of assaulting and brutalising his step-sister’s husband, identified as Usman.SaharaReporters gathered that Usman’s property was also vandalised by the military officer and his colleagues. The incident occurred at Dashonon ward in the Jos South Local Government area of Plateau State last Friday.“On Wednesday evening, December 23, 2021, one Abubakar, a former head driver of NASCO group of Companies Jos, called Usman on phone that Sumayya, his wife who was married to him under Islamic law wanted to pack her belongings out of his house without being divorced by Usman or the Sharia court,” one of the sources told SaharaReporters.“Abubakar is married to Sumayya’s mother; so he is her foster father. Usman told him that was not possible. So Abubakar came to meet one Muhammad who is Usman’s friend but suddenly, he saw Usman at Muhammad’s place. Abubakar attacked Usman and injured his eye.“Usman managed to sneak out of the house and went away, but Abubakar maintained he was going to pack Sumayya's property by fire by force.“On the 24th of December 2021, Abubakar informed his son, Mohammed Usman, who is a Flying Officer serving in Kaduna State about the incident. The NAF officer then sent one Aminu who is a Warrant Officer serving in Jos to come and deal with Usman; Aminu came in military uniform but Usman was not around.“When Usman came back, he was advised to report the matter to the police which he did. Immediately, he reported the matter to Anglo-Jos Police Station in Jos. At around 8pm, Mohammed Usman, the air force officer serving in Kaduna sneaked from his place of assignment to come to Jos; he took Aminu a warrant officer and his friends from the NAF base in Jos and they all stormed Usman’s house.“They broke into his compound and packed all his properties; they brutalised him and took him to an unknown place. He was later taken to the police station and detained by police officers till Saturday morning, and up till date; Abubakar’s children continue to threaten Usman.”
