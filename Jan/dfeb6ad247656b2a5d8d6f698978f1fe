The United Nations has called on the Burkina Faso military to immediately release President Roch Kabore and other top government officials held hostage. The UN human rights office condemned the military takeover while calling for a return to ”the constitutional order” saying it was crucial to preserve democratic space in the West African nation and ensure that the rule of law was respected.  AFP quoted the spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani as saying, “We call on the military to immediately release President Roch Marc Christian Kabore and other high-level officials who have been detained. We urge a swift return to constitutional order.” Michelle Bachelet, the UN high commissioner for human rights, visited the country in November 2021, when she stressed the importance of preserving the democratic and human rights gains made there. “The high commissioner deeply deplores the military takeover of power in Burkina Faso,” said Shamdasani. “In the face of the security threats and tremendous humanitarian challenges facing the country, it is more important than ever to ensure that the rule of law, constitutional order, and the country’s obligations under international human rights law are fully respected,” the spokeswoman added. “It is crucial for democratic space to be effectively protected, to ensure people are able to air their grievances and aspirations, and to participate in meaningful dialogue to work towards addressing the many crises in the country.” Bachelet’s office pledged to continue monitoring the human rights situation in Burkina Faso. On Monday, soldiers in Burkina Faso announced on state television that they had seized power in the West African nation. They declared that the country's government and parliament had been dissolved henceforth. They also said they had closed the country’s borders and promised a “return to constitutional order” within a “reasonable time”.
