SaharaReporters gathered that the markets are established in Daban Gajere, located very close to Bulwa Bakin Dam and Tamfalla in the Marte Local Government Area.  “The markets are expected to be open for business on Wednesday and Thursday of every week,” SaharaReporters was told. It is not the first time that the brazen terrorists would establish markets, determine levies and fees for traders and collect revenue. In 2019, the terror group took full control of some strategic fishing communities in the Lake Chad of Nigeria and established markets in Kusiri in Chad and Kinchhandi in Niger Republic. SaharaReporters also reported how ISWAP established two Wilaya’s (Caliphates) at Lake Chad and Sambisa forest to sustain its war against countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.
