The government of the United Kingdom has ordered the withdrawal of some of its diplomats and their families from Ukraine. This is a result of growing expectations that Russia could stage an attack. 





It was gathered that half of diplomatic staff and their families stationed at the UK’s outpost in Kyiv are expected to leave the country.This was after the US ordered families of American diplomats out of the country for the same reason, and offered non-essential embassy staff flights home.The EU said that it had no plans to withdraw its own diplomatic staff, with top diplomat Josep Borrell saying there is no need to ‘dramatise’ the situation.According to Daily Mail, Russia has amassed 100,000 troops on the Ukrainian border and issued a list of security demands to the US and its NATO allies.The alliance has described most of the list including a ban on Ukraine joining and the withdrawal of troops from ex-Soviet states as ‘non-starters’.However, high-level talks are ongoing with the US due to provide written responses this week.
