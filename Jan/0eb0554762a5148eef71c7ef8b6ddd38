United States senator from Vermont, Patrick Leahy, has raised concerns about the charges and trial of the Chairman of Human and Environmental Development Agenda, (HEDA Resource Centre), Olanrewaju Suraju by the Nigerian government.Leahy on Sunday noted that Suraju had been a “brave voice against corruption” and the Nigerian judiciary must strive to uphold the rule of law in the matter. SaharaReporters had earlier today reported that the Federal High Court in Abuja presided over by Justice Binta Nyako will on Monday preside over the cyberstalking charge preferred against Suraj by the Nigerian government.A former Minister of Justice, Bello Adoke, one of those accused of and charged with fraud in the OPL245 scam, also referred to as Malabu scandal, had petitioned the police. Adoke had accused those behind the petitions resulting in his prosecution for corruption and money laundering that they circulated fabricated evidence against him to unduly incriminate him in the multi-million dollar scandal. Patrick Leahy, an American politician and attorney who is the senior US senator and president pro tempore of the US Senate, on Twitter, said, “I and others in Washington are concerned with the charges against Olanrewaju Suraju who has been a brave voice against corruption. We look to Nigeria’s judiciary to uphold the rule of law and freedom of expression.” I and others in Washington are concerned with the charges against Olanrewaju Suraju who has been a brave voice against corruption.
