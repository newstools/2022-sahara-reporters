A Nigerian Juju music maestro, Dayo Kujore, popularly known as ‘Wonder Boy' has reportedly passed on. Ayinke Kujore, a daughter to the Soko Extra Crooner, confirmed the news on Monday.  According to her, the music maestro gave up the ghost earlier today. However, details of the incident are still sketchy as of the time of filing this report. Dayo Kujore was born into the family of Elder and Mrs Kujore in Igbore compound, Egba, Abeokuta, Ogun State on April 4, 1958. The news of his death comes a week after Nigerian singer, Joshua Olonitan (Slim Joe) died from a prolonged battle with renal failure. His death had been announced on January 1 by one of his friends and colleague, Raymond Gbaji, on Facebook. According to reports, Slim Joe died at the age of 30. It was reported last year that the musician was battling organ failure.

Some of his songs include: ‘Bless my hustle,’ ‘Packaging’ featuring Don Jazzy and ‘Biliwo’ featuring Iyanya.
