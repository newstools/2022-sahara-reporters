Two trailers conveying about 600 strange persons have arrived Maihula town in the Bali Local Government Area of Taraba State, sparking tension among residents.  Youths in the town have, however, mobilised and chased the vehicles and occupants away.  A resident of Maihula, Sanusi Maihula, told SaharaReporters that the strangers including women and children may have come from Zamfara State.  He said, "We found the strangers in the town early in the morning on Thursday (today).  "The strangers came into the town in two trailers and there is tension because we do not know their mission. The youth have protested and asked them to leave the town.  "They had to leave because kidnapping and banditry have made it difficult to welcome strangers nowadays.”  When contacted, Taraba State Police Commissioner, Sokoya Abimbola, said, "I know Maihula town in Bali Local Government Area but I'm not aware of any such strange persons reported to have moved there."
