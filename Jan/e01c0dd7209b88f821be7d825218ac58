Alhaji Umaru Abdul Mutallab, father of Farouk Abdul Mutallab, who is serving a life sentence in a United States prison for terrorism, has expressed hope of seeing his son again in his lifetime.  Farouk at the age of 23 had attempted to detonate plastic explosives hidden in his underwear aboard Northwest Airlines Flight 253.  The aircraft was flying from Amsterdam to Detroit, Michigan, on Christmas Day, 2009, when the incident happened.  He was sentenced to life in prison without parole after he had pleaded guilty to attempting to blow up a commercial plane as a would-be suicide mission for al-Qaeda.  Almost 300 people were on the flight from Amsterdam to Detroit.  Farouk was badly burned when the bomb sewn into his underwear failed to detonate fully, prosecutors said.  His father affirmed that he is touch with his son.  “Yes, he phones us, sometimes two times, sometimes three times in a month.  “We cannot phone him. He’s the one who can phone us and we do speak.  “As a matter of fact, his mother, one of his brothers and one of his sisters were with him about three weeks ago.  “They visited him under very strict prison guidelines. But we would keep on praying to Almighty Allah.  “Maybe one day… maybe in my lifetime we would see him back.  “But it is a situation whereby he has three life sentences, plus 40 years. It is a lot.  “But only Almighty Allah will bring us into a situation of seeing him in this world, with his siblings here in Nigeria,” he said.
