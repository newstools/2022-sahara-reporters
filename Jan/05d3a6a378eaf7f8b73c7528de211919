Governor Samuel Ortom, on Tuesday, unveiled the Benue State Humanitarian Response Plan, BSHRP 2022 to rescue the over 1.5 million Internally Displaced Persons in the state stuck in camps over insecurity. According to Ortom, the security situation had compelled the displaced people to remain in the camps. Governor Samuel Ortom He said, “It is the security situation that has kept the IDPs in the camps till now. Those who attempted going back were attacked and killed.” “I don’t desire that anyone should be in the camp. I have interacted with them and nobody wants to be there. It is worrisome for a state like Benue which is agrarian and supported by the civil service to have over 1.5 million Internally Displaced Persons. Farming activities have been brought to a halt.” Governor Ortom appreciated the various stakeholders in the humanitarian response for standing by the state and supporting the people all this while. Earlier in a remark, Chairman, document drafting committee, Professor Magdalene Dura disclosed that on June 17, 2021, Governor Ortom set up a Multisectoral Technical Committee to work on a Humanitarian Response Plan for Benue State. “The plan is a practical demonstration of the commitment of the state government and its partners to a full-fledged response to the humanitarian crisis in the state. From 2011 to the end of 2021, 21 out of the 23 Local Government Areas in the state have come under attack by herdsmen, leading to the displacement of over 1.5 million people. “The dire humanitarian situation in the state is further compounded by the influx of Cameroonian refugees into kwande Local Government escaping the conflict in their country.
