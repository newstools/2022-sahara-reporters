Gunmen suspected to be bandits have attacked Sabon Birnin Birnin village in the Igabi Local Government Area of Kaduna State leaving dead seven members of the same family.This was confirmed by the Kaduna State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan who said security agencies are working assiduously to contain the attacks and also get an update on the number of casualties, according to Channels TV. Meanwhile, some residents said the incident occurred on Monday night when the bandits in their large numbers invaded the community and started shooting sporadically, killing the family members in the process.Police authorities are, however, yet to respond to the incident.The incident has, however, caused a mass exodus of residents from the area due to fear of being attacked or killed by marauding bandits, a community leader, Bello Musa, said.He, however, appealed to the Federal Government to deploy more troops to Igabi and other troubled zones in Kaduna State in order to protect the people from further attacks.The gunmen carried a similar attack on 13 other villages in Kerawa ward in the Igabi local government area, killing no fewer than 17 people.According to a resident of the community, the attacks were carried out simultaneously in the villages.
