President Muhammadu Buhari's scheduled trip to Zamfara State on Thursday has been cancelled. According to a statement by Femi Adesina, Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, the planned visit was cancelled due to unfavourable weather conditions. As a result, Buhari made an audio-visual broadcast to the people of the state to commiserate with them over their loss, Adesina said. Buhari had earlier planned to visit Zamfara State to condole with the people over the recent attacks by bandits, who had recently been declared as terrorists. He, however, directed security agencies to sustain the onslaught against terrorists, restrict cross-boundary infiltration and all unauthorised access to the goldmines in the state. He said, “It pains me that I can no longer be with you today as I had planned. I had just finished what I came to do in Sokoto at the BUA cement facility and was looking forward to meeting you. ”I have been told that the trip cannot hold anymore because of bad weather which has made it impossible for my helicopter to fly to Gusau from Sokoto.
