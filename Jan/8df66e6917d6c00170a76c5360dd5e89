Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Political Matters, Babafemi Ojudu, has said that he had been receiving threat messages from “irritants” for disclosing that he will not support the presidential ambition of All Progressives Congress National Leader, Bola Tinubu. Ojudu specified that his decision not to support Tinubu was based on personal conviction, adding that any coercion to do otherwise would not be democratic. Babafemi Ojudu In a statement on Tuesday, Ojudu, said he should not be seen as a betrayer for not supporting the presidential aspiration of the former Lagos State governor. Ojudu said, “The idea that everyone who has related with Tinubu and disagrees with him on this presidential bid is a traitor and a betrayal is puerile. Many of us, his associates, were not made by him as you also want the world to believe. “We were already made before meeting him and in the cause of relating we gave one another a helping hand… So, on this matter of 2023 I wish him (Tinubu) well but I cannot in good conscience give him my support or cast my vote for him in the coming primary. It is my right. I am above 60 years of age for God sake. I almost died seeking this inalienable democratic rights, held up in detention and severally tortured. Your god is not my god. “Let no one think he can browbeat or blackmail me to do what does not go with my conscience or my ideals. Enough of your phone threats and embarrassment of my family members. “For the irritants who have been sending threat messages to me and members of my family or calling to abuse me for not supporting Tinubu, do know that is not democracy. It is something else. I spent my youth years fighting autocracy and intolerance of the military and I am still willing and ready, even now, to stand up for what I believe, even if it will cost me my life. Enough said.”
