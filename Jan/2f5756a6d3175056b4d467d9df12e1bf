The Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja has reserved judgment in the case filed by the human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore, challenging the ruling of the Federal High Court in confining him to Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) since August 2019. A three man panel led by Justice Tsammani made this pronouncement and reserved the judgment to a later date after he had listened to the submissions from both parties. Omoyele Sowore in court. At the resumed hearing, of the case on Monday, counsel to the appellant, Deji Morakinyo, who was holding brief for Femi Falana, submitted that the appeal was to challenge the decision of the Federal High Court delivered on October 21, 2019, by Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu, restricting the appellant to Abuja. He adopted the appellant’s brief of argument and urged the court to allow the appeal and set aside the ruling of the lower court. On his own part, counsel to the Nigerian government, Bagudu Sani, submitted that they equally filed a respondent's brief of argument and therefore asked the court to dismiss the appeal. It would be recalled that Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu of the Federal High Court on October 4, 2019, granted bail of N100million to Mr Sowore. Ms Ojukwu said Mr Sowore should produce two sureties in like sum. Of the N100 million, N50million was to be deposited with the court while the balance was to be put in place should Sowore jump bail. The court said Sowore’s sureties must deposit tax clearance certificates for three years, 2016 to 2018, and documents of landed properties in Abuja. The sureties were also to deposit affidavit of means for their assets. The court ruled that when released after meeting his bail conditions, Sowore should remain in Abuja till the case was determined.
