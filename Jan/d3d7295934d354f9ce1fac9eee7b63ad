Shuaib Labaran, the lead counsel to the Nigerian government in the trial of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu says he (Kanu) denied membership of the group. The Nigerian government had laid charges of treason against Kanu, including 15 fresh charges which were filed on Monday.  Magaji stated this while speaking with journalists at the court premises after the trial was adjourned to February 16. The lawyer, who brought two prosecution witnesses to court on Wednesday, expressed disappointment that the trial could not begin immediately. According to him, the defence team ambushed the court with an application for bail and another application seeking to quash the charges against Kanu. Magaji added that Kanu “vehemently” denied being an IPOB member.

That is very curious and we urge Nigerians to see us through how we are going to prove all those charges against the defendant in no time to come.” Kanu had on Wednesday pleaded not guilty to the 15-count amended charge bordering on treasonable felony and terrorism, brought against him by the Nigerian government. He said he was innocent of all the allegations the government leveled against him after the charge was read to him in the open court. The Buhari-led government had filed fresh terrorism charges against the detained IPOB leader before the Federal High Court in Abuja on Monday.
