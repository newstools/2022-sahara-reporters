An Abuja high court has again adjourned further proceedings in the case filed by some oil producing communities in Ondo State over the refusal of the Nigerian Government to constitute a substantial board for the Niger Delta Development Commission.The communities had taken the government to court over what it described as ongoing illegality following the running of the NDDC by a sole administrator. The group claimed that the move was a breach of the law governing the operation.They thereafter asked the court to order President Buhari to stop the illegality.The communities said the action had also enabled certain officials of government to divert attention from the collective legitimate demands of Niger Delta stakeholders for the inauguration of the NDDC Governing Board.The latest adjournment of the case on Wednesday followed the unavailability of the presiding judge.“It was initially adjourned to January 14 but the judge did not come. It was later adjourned to January 19, the judge too refused to come and then adjourned to January 25 which is today. "The judge didn’t show up again and the case was adjourned to February 2.“Minister of Niger Delta, Godswill Akpabio, has been bragging that the judge is under his belt,” a source told SaharaReporters.
