Nigeria has dropped to 149 on Transparency International’s 2021 Corruption Perception Index as the second most corrupt country in West Africa. This is the worst ranking received by Africa’s largest country in recent time. Nigeria also scored 24 out of a possible 100 points.  This was revealed in the 2021 Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) ranking released on Tuesday by the Transparency International (TI). It is Nigeria’s second consecutive year of a downward spiral on the TI’s CPI ranking, the country’s score having dropped from 26 in 2019 to 25 in the 2020 assessment, and further to 24 in the latest 2021 record. Nigeria was ranked 146th out of the 180 countries surveyed, in the last TI rating in 2019, scoring 26 points out of a possible 100. On a scale of zero to 100 in TI’s rating, zero means “Highly Corrupt,” while 100 stands for “Very Clean”. The summation is simply that corruption in the country has worsened. The ranking may be an indicator that corruption in the country has got worse over the years.
