The Islamic State-backed faction of Boko Haram, the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), formerly known as Jamā'at Ahl as-Sunnah lid-Da'wah wa'l-Jihād in Borno State, has named a teenager, Abu Sulayman al-Ansari, as the suicide bomber who rammed an explosives-laden pick-up truck into a military post in Borno State. SaharaReporters had earlier reported how a Jihadist fighter targeted the military post in Marte, located near the shores of Lake Chad, killing about soldiers.  The insurgents also engaged the Nigerian troops in a gun battle. The terror group in a post added that it razed down the facility, while armoured tank and military operational vehicles were captured. ISWAP, which split from the mainstream Boko Haram in 2016, has become a dominant group, focusing on military targets and high-profile attacks, including against aid workers. Since the death of JAS leader, Abubakar Shekau, the group has been consolidating its grip in locations around Lake Chad. Just recently, it appointed Wali Sani Shuwaram, a 45-year-old as the new Leader (Wali) of ISWAP in Lake Chad. The sect’s membership has swollen with the defection of hundreds of Boko Haram fighters under Shekau. In 2021, at least 33 soldiers were killed when two explosive-laden vehicles rammed into a military convoy in Wulgo. The suicide bombers were identified as Abu Bakr al-Siddiq and Bana Jundullah. The group also claimed four military vehicles were destroyed.
