The proprietor of the school, Abdulmalik Tanko, had earlier abducted the little girl and eventually killed the pupil despite collecting ransom.  Hanifa and many others were coming back from an Islamic class when a tricycle offered to give them a lift. But while others had alighted from the tricycle, the driver had asked Hanifa to stay behind so that he could further give her a lift to her compound.

SaharaReporters had reported how Tanko masterminded the abduction of Hanfia, while on her way from Islamiyya School in December and subsequently killed her.
