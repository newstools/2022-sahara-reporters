The Ebonyi State Government has warned that residents of the state who comply with the sit-at-home order by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), on Tuesday will be severely punished. IPOB has given a directive that there will be boycott of business activities tomorrow as its leader, Nnamdi Kanu, appears at the Federal High Court in Abuja. Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi Reacting, the state’s Commissioner for Markets and Parks, Nwachukwu Eze, urged leaders of markets to ensure shops, stall and business centres are open and active for commercial purposes. Eze vowed to mete out severe punishment for those who fail to open for business in Ebonyi state. According to Eze, “All markets and parks leaderships in Ebonyi are by this announcement directed to ensure that markets are open for businesses on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. “The state is not in any way part of the sit-at-home order by IPOB. Please note that strict compliance to this directive is very important as failure to do so will attract severe punishment.”
