The operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS) have said the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, refused to wear another clothes to appear in court. The DSS said this when Justice Binta Nyako queried why her order was flouted.  Nyako had ordered yesterday that the detained IPOB leader should not appear in court today in the same Fendi designers clothes he has been wearing since June last year when he was arrested. Kanu was on same clothes today, sparking a debate over why her order was flouted.

1 Day Ago The prosecution team told the court that provision was made for a change of clothing for Kanu, but that the pro-Biafra secessionist rejected them on grounds that he preferred the designers Fendi he had on. When the matter was called up, the prosecution counsel, Mr Shuaibu Labaran, told the court that Kanu was the one that chose to wear his designer Fendi clothes. He said, “My lord, based on your order yesterday, we provided the defendant with a new orthopedic mattress, pillows and blankets. As for his appearance, he chose to wear this particular one because he said that it is designers.”

10 Hours Ago However, Kanu’s lead counsel, Chief Mike Ozekhome(SAN) told the court that it was not true that his client insisted on wearing his designer’s clothes. “My Lord, what happened was that by the time proceedings ended yesterday, and because it was not his visiting day, we were not able to pass to him some clothes we obtained for him. “We even discussed it with him this morning and he said that on the next visiting day, he would want to have the new clothes,” Ozekhome said. Before allowing Kanu to be re-arraigned on the amended 15-count treasonable felony charge the Federal Government preferred against him, Justice Nyako reiterated her demand for him to have a change of clothing. The court has adjourned the trial to February 16, 2022.
