 There was panic in Enugu State on Monday morning when some gunmen were seen enforcing the suspended sit-at-home order and attacking residents in Obollo-Afor, the headquarters of Udenu Local Government Area. It was learnt that the gunmen who entered the commercial town on motorcycles were seen beating traders who had opened shops for business.  The gunmen arrived at the town around 8:30am and are currently patrolling it to ensure that there is compliance with the sit-at-home order, purportedly issued by the Indigenous People of Biafra. A tricycle was burnt by the hoodlums while residents were seen scampering for safety as the hoodlums chased them down with whips. According to Daily Sun, members of Udenu Central Neighbourhood Watch took to their heels on sighting the gunmen. A Sienna car belonging to the group was destroyed in the attack.
