The hoodlums beat me to comma and one of them openly warned me to stop granting interview in radio and criticising the government,” he stated.According to the APC chieftain, one of the victims was critically injured and receiving treatment at the specialist Hospital, Yola.Sarki in a swift response said the state command of the State Security Service (SSS) had invited him on the matter. He denied the allegation and described it as “cheap blackmail.”“I was invited by DSS in the state over the matter where I categorically told them that I don’t know anything about the alleged attacks,” Sarki noted.
