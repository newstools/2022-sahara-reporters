An All Progressives Congress party chieftain, Abdulmumin Jibrin, has stated that the party could no rally round Vice President Yemi Osinbajo who is reportedly nursing a 2023 presidential ambition because it is a wrong time for the Vice-President to vie for office.Jibrin claimed that former Lagos State governor, Bola Tinubu, ought to succeed the president, and was more solid than Osinbajo. The chieftain, who is also the Director-General, Bola Ahmed Tinubu Support Group Management Council, said these during an interview with Arise TV on Tuesday, monitored by SaharaReporters.The journalist conducting the interview had asked Jibrin to explain how Tinubu made his wealth amidst allegations of bullion vans bringing state funds to his residence in 2019.Jibrin replied, “What we should focus on is the pedigree of the person. How he achieved his plan in Lagos, the infrastructure. These are what we should look at. The focus now should be the capacity and competence of the candidate.”“I’m also putting it to you. You have asked your question and I’ll give you a simple and clear answer. And when you continue to repeat the question, you’ll receive the same answer. They are all trash from the internet that people keep together, and we will not elevate such conversation. When the campaign commences, we will bring out facts and figures before Nigerians.“I like Osinbajo. Good Vice President and everything; people even said in modern democracy, vice president succeeds president. But unfortunately in all of the parameters that he will use, Asiwaju (Tinubu) is still ahead of him and we want to win the election."So, if you say the vice president, Asiwaju is the National Leader of the party. So in modern democracy as well, it is the National Leader that succeeds the President. Unfortunately, personally I will say it is a wrong timing for him (Osinbajo), otherwise, we will have rallied round him.”
