Proprietor of Noble Kids School in Nasarawa Local Government Area of Kano State, Abdulmalik Tanko, was on Monday, arraigned before a magistrate’s court in Kano.  According to reports, he was arraigned before Senior Magistrate Muhammad Jibril following the role he played in the murder of Hanifa Abubakar, a five-year-old pupil of the school.  Tanko had earlier abducted the little girl and eventually killed her despite collecting ransom.  SaharaReporters had reported how Tanko masterminded the abduction of Hanifa while on her way from Islamiyya School in December and subsequently killed her.  He had demanded N6million ransom from the parents of the child and in the process of collecting part of the money, he was arrested.  He had failed to disclose that the victim had been killed.  When he was paraded at the Kano Police Command headquarters on Friday, he told journalists that he killed the girl with a rat poison he bought for N100.  Tanko had earlier confessed that he killed the girl because she could recognise him.  Also on Monday, some angry youth  set ablaze Noble Kids School over the abduction and killing of Hanifa.
