Many Nigerians have donated to Saidu Faskari, the farmer seen removing the roof of his house in Katsina State to sell in order to rescue his son from kidnappers. A local journalist working with an online news website, Katsina Daily Post News, Ibrahim Bawa, had posted a video clip and pictures of Faskari while his roofing sheet was being removed as he gathered money to rescue his son from bandits.  They had asked for a N100,000 ransom from the farmer for the release of his son who was abducted in Faskari Local Government Area. Sources told SaharaReporters that many Nigerians came to the farmer’s aid after the story went viral. His son was also released after the N100,000 ransom was paid to the bandits.
