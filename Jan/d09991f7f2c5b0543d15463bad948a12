United States has launched a unique web-based portal, ReportMagoMago.com, that leverages citizen engagement to fight corruption. US Consul General, Claire Pierangelo, speaking on Friday in Lagos during the launch of the site, said countering corruption in Nigeria was not only a key concern in Nigeria but also a core US national security priority for the Joe Biden administration.  She hinted that the initiative aimed at putting power to report corruption in the hands of Nigerians. She said “Countering corruption is not only a key concern in Nigeria but also a core U.S. national security priority for the Biden administration. Growth and development, consistent with the richness and strength of Nigeria, depend on a new narrative and a culture where corruption has no place. "Nigerians should demonstrate their commitment to the fight against corruption by using the innovative online platform seeking to address the daily instances of corruption faced by millions of Nigerians. "The new initiative would encourage Nigerians affected by corruption to feel empowered to share their experiences and spark a new movement in citizen engagement in fighting the scourge that had hampered development and stifled prosperity in the country. "The US Government is committed to supporting anti-corruption initiatives and collaborative efforts to prevent graft, strengthen investigation and prosecution of corruption, promote accountability and transparency, and empower reformers." The event was held in collaboration with the Inter-Religious Coalition Against Corruption in Nigeria.
