The Nigerian Human Rights Community, a non-profit organisation, has said that the direct primary election as conducted by the All Progressives Congress to pick its candidate for the June 18 Ekiti governorship election had once again underscored the need for people’s participation in the choice of their leaders.NHRC in a statement stated that the manner the outcome of the exercise was celebrated across the state indicated expression of a popular choice.Former Secretary to Ekiti State Government, Biodun Oyebanji, emerged victorious in the exercise. The group said the APC Ekiti primary election was not without challenges but the poll proved that direct participation of members of political parties in choosing candidates remained the best option.The statement reads, "The primary was not without minor hitches but that it represented the wish and aspirations of the majority of members of APC in Ekiti State.“Nigerians should disregard reports being released by people who did not witness or monitor the primary – they are guided by stereotyping, wild assumptions and aspirants who saw the primary as a ‘must win’ venture.“We saw people’s enthusiasm, confidence and trust in democracy. Even in the face of prevailing challenges, people feel honoured and excited that they were involved in choosing who would represent their political party at the poll.“This feeling of excitement strengthens the prospect of greater inclusion and public participation in party internal democracy.“The Ekiti primary demonstrated inclusion and expresses the potential and powers possessed by the electorates and their ability to make tremendous input into the process that produced the aspirant of the party they belong to."
