4 Weeks Ago The minister said the Nigerian Government had also directed the National Broadcasting Commission to immediately commence the process of licensing all OTT and social media operations in Nigeria. The development comes after Twitter deleted President Muhammadu Buhari’s tweet where he threatened to treat Nigerians “misbehaving” in “the language they understand”. Buhari had in a tweet stated that his government would get “harder” on those hell-bent on destroying the country. Following widespread condemnation of the tweet, Twitter deleted the message. The platform said the message by the Nigerian President violated its rules. Following the suspension, SERAP and 176 concerned Nigerians filed a suit before the ECOWAS court, challenging the Nigerian Government’s decision. “The ECOWAS Court in Abuja has today issued a hearing notice to parties to confirm that the SERAP (and others) suit on the illegal Twitter ban has been fixed for judgment on the 20th day of January, 2022 at 10:00am,” SERAP said in a post on its Twitter page.
