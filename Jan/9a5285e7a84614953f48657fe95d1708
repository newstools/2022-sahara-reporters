The police in Bangladeshi have arrested nine members of an alleged fraud gang including six Nigerians and one South African. Those arrested are Udeze Obinna Ruben, 42; Ntombikhona Gebuza, 36; Ifunanya Vivian Nnawuike, 31; Sunday Shederack Ejim, 32; Chinedu Moses Nnaji, 36; Collims Ifesinachi Talike, 30; Chidimma Ebele Eylofor, 26; Nahidul Islam, 30; and Sonia Akter, 33.  They were apprehended in overnight drives from Pallabi, Rupnagar and Dakkhin Khan areas of Dhaka, the capital on Wednesday. It was reported that the nabbed Africans are staying in Bangladesh on tourist visas yet engaging in fraud under the cover of selling ready-made garments, police director, Mozammel Huque, said, on Thursday, while addressing a press conference. He claimed the group had long been defrauding Bangladeshis, swindling nearly 30 out of huge sums of money. "They operated through romance scams on social media, fake package delivery services, and by organizing fake online prizes," Mozammel said. The police unit also recovered eight passports, 31 mobile phones, three laptops, one cheque book, three pen drives, and cash from their possession. Mozammel said arrested Udeze is the key figure of the group, while Sonia Akter and Nahidul Islam are the local members.
