The Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) on Wednesday denied that it had endorsed the 2023 presidential ambition of former Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu. According to the association, the position of individuals on who succeeds President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023 should not be regarded as a general one.  MACBAN had on Sunday said the welfare of its members would improve with Bola Tinubu, national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), as president in 2023. During a meeting held at the Agricultural and Rural Management Training Institute, Abuja, the association had reiterated its commitment to better the lifestyle of its members. The meeting had drawn the Fulani leaders from the 36 states and the FCT, Abuja. Ya’u Haruna, convener of the meeting and a former chairman of the Jigawa chapter of MACBAN, had said the association was paying attention to those who had shown their interest in contesting the 2023 presidency, including Tinubu.

Ahmed Tinubu. “We want to make it clear that the association has not endorsed any candidate. Those who endorsed Tinubu are doing so as individuals. MACBAN should not in any way be dragged into the politics of endorsement at this stage,” Ngelzarma said.
