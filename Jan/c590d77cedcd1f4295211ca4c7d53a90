If anybody tells you about Biafra, Ebonyi State will never be part of Biafra. We are not Biafra. “We were so oppressed and now we are finding our feet and you want us to go back. We will not. We will not. We are better in a fair and equitable Nigeria. And we are not going anywhere. “We are not going anywhere. We won’t.
