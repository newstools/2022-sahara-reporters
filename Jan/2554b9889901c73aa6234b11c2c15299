Supporters of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, engaged in a physical battle with members of security operatives at the Federal High Court in Abuja on Tuesday. Reports reaching SaharaReporters said Kanu’s supporters kept chanting, “Holy Holy Holy, Nnamdi Kanu is another saviour."  There had been fisticuffs at the last court appearance also in December 2021 between the IPOB leader’s supporters and operatives of the Department of State Services. SaharaReporters had earlier reported that Kanu is currently being arraigned in the Federal High Court over some amended charge levelled against him by the Federal Government. This is as the lead counsel for the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Ifeanyi Ejiofor, on Tuesday, unveiled Chief Mike Ozekhome, as the leader of the defence counsel for Nnamdi Kanu, whose trial was ongoing before Justice Binta Nyako of a Federal High Court in Abuja. Some journalists who arrived at the Federal High Court to cover the proceedings were also barred from accessing the court premises.
