A former acting Director of the Federal Institute of Industrial Research (FIIRO), Oshodi, Lagos State, Chima Igwe, being prosecuted by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) for forging his certificate has been promoted to the position of a director. President Buhari had in 2021 ordered the ICPC to prosecute Igwe, for manipulation of his educational status to exploit the system for personal gains.  He is being tried at an Ikeja High Court over the matter following orders from the Presidency. Igwe was caught in a web of dirty scams after submitting a Doctor of Philosophy certificate that was later discovered to be fake. The doctorate which he claimed he completed at the Universite D’Abomey Calavi, Benin Republic, in 2001, was non-existent. An investigation earlier by ICPC indicted him and was demoted by President Buhari to the position he held more than 18 years ago but he refused to resume at the post. But an internal memo obtained on Tuesday showed that the Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, had ordered his return to the position of director in the institute. The memo, signed by the acting Director, Human Resources Management and Administration, C.A. Ibe, and dated March 21, 2022, was titled, “Reverting to Status Quo on the Position of Dr Chima Igwe as Director, Chemical, Fibre and Environmental Technology Department.” It read, “I am directed to inform you that following the recommendation of a report of the ministerial committee on the Federal Institute of Industrial Research Oshodi, the directive of the Governing Board and the approval of the Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, the status quo on the position of Dr Chima C. Igwe is hereby maintained. “Consequently, all staff under the above-named department are expected to comply accordingly. Kindly note, for the sake of emphasis, that Dr Chima C. Igwe remains the substantive director of the department.”
