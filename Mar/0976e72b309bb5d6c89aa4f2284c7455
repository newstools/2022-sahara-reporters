A former Minister of Works, Ambassador Ibrahim Musa Kazaure has counted himself among Nigerian politicians that should be jailed for failing the country, by embezzling public funds. According to Radio France International programme, the former lawmaker said all Nigerian politicians are the same, stressing that none has had the genuine interest of the masses at heart.  He said he had asked President Muhammadu Buhari to arrest all politicians who embezzled public funds, including himself. Lamenting the current economic reality in the country, the ex-Minister said all Nigerians who had occupied public offices since 1999 had done nothing. He said, “Even me talking to you, what we did to Nigeria, we deserve to be jailed. “I used to say, I, Ibrahim Musa Kazaure, we have cheated Nigeria and her poor masses. “The truth is that we are all the same. What we did during our time wasn’t what we should have done, because some of us got the opportunity and some did not. “It is only in Nigeria that the education system is still going on strike every time. Then when are we going to develop? I am not going to occupy any seat in Nigeria again, even if they will give me for free, I will not. “I challenge everyone in the country, even the president, go and check. I have spoken the truth. Whoever stole Nigeria’s money should return it. I told President Buhari that whoever stole should be arrested, including myself, we should return it if proven.”
