Air Peace has suspended flight operations to Kaduna International Airport in Kaduna State. According to a source who spoke with Daily Trust, the development may not be unconnected to the gun attack around the airport at the weekend.  Recall that on Saturday, a staff of the Nigerian Airspace Management Authority was shot dead as bandits invaded the Kaduna Airport. This is even as the bandits prevented an Azman aircraft scheduled for Lagos from taking off at the Kaduna Airport. It was gathered that the AZMAN aircraft could not take off at about 12:30pm because of the presence of the bandits around the runway of the airport. On Tuesday, Azman announced an indefinite suspension of its flights to Kaduna over insecurity. Hours later, the news of Air Peace halting operations to Kaduna broke. The development was confirmed by Air Peace Spokesman, Stanley Olisa who did not go into further details.
