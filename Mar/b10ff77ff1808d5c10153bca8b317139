Prof Chukwuma Soludo, Anambra State Governor, on Monday visited some offices within the Government House in Awka, Anambra State.A circular had been issued by the Head of Service, Anambra State, Theodora Igwegbe, to all civil servants last week to report to work every Monday of the week as against the sit-at-home order originally issued by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). Soludo on assuming office as Governor of Anambra had appealed to all armed groups to lay down their arms and come out of the forests.Soludo had also on several forums decried the Monday weekly sit-at-home which has deeply affected the economic activities of the state.The governor had asserted that the sit-at-home syndrome had further impaired the people’s economic fortunes, especially those who engaged in daily income businesses.The governor had also met with market women and transport union leaders last week in a meeting and discussed on putting a stop to the Monday weekly sit-at-home order.On that occasion, both Soludo and the market and transport union leaders agreed to put an end to the weekly sit-at-home order by reporting to work and also ensuring that shops were open for business every Monday.In Awka, activities resumed as cars and people were seen moving freely around, but at the Jerome Udorji secretariat, most offices were empty and the few workers who reported to duty were seen leaving for home at about 12.30pm.Some civil servants residing outside the state capital who spoke with Vanguard on phone said they made attempt to obey the governor’s order, but could not find vehicles to convey them to Awka.It was observed that most intercity transport operators, including government – owned Transport Company of Anambra State, TRACAS, did not operate.Similarly, the numerous government buses designated for conveying workers to offices from Onitsha, Nnewi, Ekwulobia, Otuocha, among other towns, did not operate.In Awka, Keke and shuttle buses were, however, doing their business, even though the patronage was low. Although Awka main market was open, most of the shops were not open and some traders who managed to get to the market, had to go back.The shopping malls in the major cities were also not open, apparently out of fear of attack by unknown gunmen who had earlier threatened to deal with people who disobeyed the sit -at -home order.However, some filling stations were attending to customers, although they were dispensing fuel at between N230 and N250 per litre of PMS, as against N200 per liter sold on Sunday.Also, some banks were attending to their customers with utmost care as their gates were half-closed while allowing customers in.
