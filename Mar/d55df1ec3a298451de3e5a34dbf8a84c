This was contained in a statement titled, “Purported release of Sunday Igboho” and issued by the lawyer on Thursday.Alliyu added that reports of Igboho fleeing to Germany should be disregarded as it was untrue.The lawyer said, “Kindly discountenance any news about the release of Chief Sunday Adeyemo or that he is on his way to Germany. It is not true, please.“With the assistance of a worldwide renowned professor and Prof Akintoye and lawyers (Falola and myself), we are negotiating for something more comfortable for him than prison to meet his health demand. I advise you to remain calm and prayerful.”Alliyu earlier announced that Benin Republic renewed Ignoho’s incarceration despite that there was no criminal charge against him and no extradition request from the Nigerian Government.Meanwhile, barely some days ago, the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, spoke about Igboho stating that the agitator may be subjected to Nigeria’s criminal justice system upon the conclusion of his incarceration by the government of the Republic of Benin.“It is a matter being prosecuted at a foreign country, and within the context of that prosecution, one thing that is apparent is that he (Igboho) has been taken into custody on account of breaching laws applicable in a foreign nation. And with that in mind, he is being prosecuted,” Malami partly said.Igboho was arrested alongside his wife in Cotonou, Benin Republic by security operatives in the West African country on July 19, 2021 after fleeing Nigeria to evade arrest by Nigeria's secret police.The DSS had declared Igboho wanted after its operatives carried out a bloody raid on his residence in the Soka area of Ibadan, Oyo State, killing two people and arresting 12 aides but Igboho escaped.DSS Public Relations Officer, Peter Afunnaya, had advised Igboho to turn himself in.However, Igboho's wife has since been released from police custody while Igboho remains in detention in the West African country.
