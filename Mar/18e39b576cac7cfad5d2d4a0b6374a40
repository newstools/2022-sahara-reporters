Jada Pinkett Smith has finally broken her silence after her husband, Will Smith, slapped comedian, Chris Rock, on stage at the Oscars over a joke made about her bald head, Daily Mail reports.  "This is a season for healing and I'm here for it," the actress posted on Instagram Tuesday, two days after the incident that stunned millions of viewers.  Pinkett, 50, posted the words on a pink background but did not share a caption.  She has remained quiet since the dramatic events unfolded Sunday night.  Her post, which appears to address the incident, comes less than a day after her husband issued an apology for slapping Rock. Pinkett suffers from alopecia but that didn’t stop Rock from joking about her bald head. This angered Will Smith who slapped Rock for disrespecting his wife.
