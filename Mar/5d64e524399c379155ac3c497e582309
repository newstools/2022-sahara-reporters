Nnamdi Kanu, the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, on Tuesday, warned that those behind the bombing of George Obiozor, the President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo’s residence in Imo State would not be forgiven. Obiozor’s residence in Imo State was razed down by some gunmen on Saturday.  The assailants attacked Obiozor’s residence using Improvised Explosive Devices, IEDs, and petrol bombs. However, the IPOB leader who condemned the bombing of Obiozor's residence spoke during his routine meeting with his legal team at the Department of State Services (DSS) headquarters in Abuja, on Monday. According to the statement by Kanu’s counsel, Ifeanyi Ejiofor, the IPOB leader expressed grave disapproval and anger over the attack on the residence of Obiozor. He urged the people of the South-East to protect elder statesmen in the region, noting that those causing havoc in the South-East should be fished out and punished in accordance with the law. The statement reads, “Onyendu (Kanu) took some time to express his anger and grave disapproval of the heinous act of destruction of the country home of the elder statesman and President General of Igbo socio-cultural group, Ohaneze Ndi Igbo, Prof George Obiozor. He describes the said destruction as cowardly and barbaric and condemns it in very strong terms. “He declared that the perpetrators of the heinous act shall not be forgiven and went ahead to direct that all persons who were in any way involved in committing the dastardly act be fished out forthwith. “Onyendu warns that our elder statesmen should be protected at all times and that the monsters desecrating Igbo land should be fished out wherever they are and severely punished, in order to serve as a deterrent to their ilk.”
