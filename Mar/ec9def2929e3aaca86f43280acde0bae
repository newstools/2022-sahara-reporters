The Kaduna State Government has directed all political appointees and public servants aspiring for political offices in the 2023 general elections to resign on or before March 31, 2022. This directive is contained in a statement issued by the Secretary to the state government, Balarabe Abbas, who said that the directive for such public office holders to resign their present appointments in the public service is in conformity with the 2022 Electoral Act recently signed by President Muhammadu Buhari.  He, therefore, said that such persons have until March 31 to tender their resignation letter to enable them to pursue their political aspirations. The 2022 Electoral Act specifies that such officers should resign from office 30 days before the party primaries for the post for which they are aspiring. Also, Governor Aminu Masari of Katsina has told his political appointees, who desire to contest elections in 2023, to comply with the provisions of the electoral act, by resigning. The governor made the call on Tuesday in Katsina while briefing journalists after a closed-door meeting with his political appointees. The meeting was also attended by Deputy Governor Mannir Yakubu. “I briefed them on certain developments in our party, APC and our preparations for the local government elections. I urged those with ambition to contest elections in 2023 to take a look at the electoral bill which was recently signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari,” Masari said. “The meeting was necessary so that they can do the needful by respecting the electoral act aimed at avoiding the avoidable. They should comply with the Electoral Act.”
