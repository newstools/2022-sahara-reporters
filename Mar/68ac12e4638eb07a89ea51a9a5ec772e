Presidential aspirant and National Chairman of the African Action Congress (AAC), Omoyele Sowore, has vowed to release from detention the leader of Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, and the leader of Yoruba Nation Agitator, Sunday Igboho, if he becomes the President of Nigeria in 2023. He made this known on Tuesday in Abuja at his formal declaration to run for the position of Nigeria’s president in the next year general elections.  Sowore said he would release all political detainees particularly IPOB Leader, Kanu, and Yoruba agitator, Igboho, because they were being held illegally in the custody. He said he threw his hat in the ring to ensure that justice was served to all ethnic groups agitating for self-determination. Sowore told those in government to intensify efforts and rehabilitate prison centres across the country saying that they might need to spend some time there after their tenure. He said, “As soon as I am sworn in on June 12, 2023, I will release all political detainees, particularly Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Igboho. People who are asking for self-determination should not go to prison. Those in the Diaspora must also be given the right to vote during the election. "We will not encourage those who put them in prison; they should be rehabilitating prisons now because they may have to spend some time there as well.” He said Nigeria would have a new constitution that would make provision for right to self- determination and referendum. “For those who are pushing the struggle for self-determination, we will accord you the opportunity you are seeking by creating a new Constitution for Nigeria, which must necessarily contain the right to self-determination and the right to a referendum if you are tired of Nigeria,” Sowore said.
