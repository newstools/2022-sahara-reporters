Men of the Lagos State Police Command have allegedly tortured a 29-year-old man identified as Sunday Agbamuche to death. SaharaReporters gathered that the deceased was illegally arrested on December 28, 2021 at Ketu Alapere of the state after a cult clash in the area.  He was subsequently moved to a detention facility of the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) in Lagos where he was allegedly tortured to death. “He was my friend; he was someone I could vouch for. Though he stubborn, he wasn’t a cultist nor involved in the clash. For the fact that he wasn’t involved in the incident, he had this liberty, that freedom to move around while those who committed the atrocities ran away,” a source told SaharaReporters. “He was arrested here in Ketu, that day, he was drunk and was even sleeping when they took him away. So I tried all effort to see how we could rescue him but he was transferred to SARS detention at the state command. I spoke with the IPO for his bail; we were on it when we heard that he had died. We heard he was maltreated and beaten to death at the SARS detention. “I asked the IPO for his corpse but he didn’t say anything.” The source urged the Inspector-General of Police and Lagos Police Commissioner to investigate Agbamuche’s death. Meanwhile, the police charged the deceased and two others to court. The two others are Lekan Salami and Adewumi Olanrewaju. They were accused of murder, armed robbery and possession of illegal fire arms.
