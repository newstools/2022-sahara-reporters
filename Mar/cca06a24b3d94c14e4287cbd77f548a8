The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has filed criminal charges against the suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police, DCP, Abba Kyari, and six others allegedly involved in a cocaine deal. The eight counts filed by the agency on Thursday comes after the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, approved the request by the US government to extradite Kyari.  The NDLEA accused DCP Kyari and the four other police officers of conspiracy, obstruction, and dealing in cocaine. The other defendants in the charge marked FHC/ABJ/57/2022 and filed before the Federal High Court in Abuja, were four policemen, ACP Sunday J. Ubia, ASP Bawa James, Insp. Simon Agirigba and Insp. John Nuhu, and two alleged drug traffickers were arrested at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport in Enugu. The suspected drug traffickers are Chibunna Patrick Umeibe and Emeka Alphonsus Ezenwanne. Meanwhile, a human rights lawyer, Inibehe Effiong had urged the NDLEA to stay action on filing charges against disgraced Police Chief, Abba Kyari. The suspended police chief was recently remanded in the custody of the NDLEA after attempting to bribe an official of the agency with $61,000 to facilitate the release of seized cocaine.  Kyari had also been accused of committing wire fraud, money laundering and identity theft.  He was also accused of working with Ramon Abbas, aka Hushpuppi, who has pleaded guilty to Internet fraud.  A grand jury in April 2021 filed an indictment against Kyari with the approval of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.  On Wednesday, the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), filed an application before the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court in Abuja for Kyari’s extradition.  The application marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/249/2022 was filed under the Extradition Act.
