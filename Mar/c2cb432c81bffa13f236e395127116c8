He added that the adoption of a similar move by Muslims in the North would be dangerous and lead Nigeria to a theocratic state.Sani was reacting to a statement from former Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu, who was reported to have urged the Supreme Council for Shari’ah in the country to create a department of political affairs to create political awareness among faithful towards producing a Muslim president in 2023.But Sani noted that such “religious groups in the North, would” breed fanaticism.https://twitter.com/ShehuSani/status/1505426120354713600He said, “Once religious groups in the North begin to set up political departments, it’s not just going to be ‘a department’ like in the RCCG, it’s going to be a breeding unit for fanatical religiously crafted political ideas in pursuit of a theocratic state. Abeg, Let the sleeping Lion lie.”Speaking at the Annual National Conference and Pre-Ramadan meeting of the Supreme Council for Shari’ah in Nigeria (SCSN), held at GMT hotel, Osogbo, Osun state, the former Lagos State Governor had said Muslims cannot afford to be left behind in political participation nationwide.While soliciting the congregation’s support towards realising his presidential bid, Tinubu, who was represented by an aide, Tunde Badmus, stressed the need to ensure that Muslims, like other groups must ensure that followers participate in the country’s political process effectively.He had said, “Other religious groups have commenced political sensitisation by creating political departments or directorates among themselves to promote their own. You should create a political wing among yourself so that it will further gear your participation in politics, it will be a good platform to support your brothers who are vying for political positions. “There is a need for us to act toward our prayers, the emergence of a good leader but we need to partake in political activities. Almighty Allah answers our prayer through our actions so while praying let us act towards it.”
