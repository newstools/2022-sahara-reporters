Bianca Ojukwu, widow of the late leader of the breakaway Republic of Biafra from 1967 to 1970, Chukwuemeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu, has shed light on what led to the fight between her and the immediate former First Lady of Anambra State, Ebelechukwu Obiano.The incident resulted in Bianca giving the former First Lady a slap during the inauguration of the new governor of Anambra State, Chukwuma Soludo on Thursday. The incident was captured in a video that has gone viral. Mrs. Obiano was heard calling Bianca ‘Ashawo’ (sex worker) in the video. In an interview with Arise TV on Friday, Bianca said she was already seated when Ebelechukwu arrived at the venue of the inauguration. She said, ''I didn't pay any attention to her arrival. Surprisingly, she then walked towards me and I thought she was coming to greet me. “Instead, she verbally attacked me with her voice raised, taunting me and asking me what I was there to do, using unprintable, vile language. “She asked if I had come to celebrate their last day in office but I ignored her completely. Then she kept on aggressively putting her hand on my shoulders and shouting. While I ignored her verbal onslaught as advised by people sitting around me, I requested twice that she refrains from touching me with her hands. “She proceeded to do so yet again and tried to touch my head and remove my headtie. It was at this point I stood up to defend myself and gave her a dirty slap to stop her from attacking me. “As she made towards me, I den pulled away her wig, she then held on to her wig with her two hands and tried to take the wig away from me. “The former APGA (All Progressives Grand Alliance) chairman, Umeh, told her to leave me and told everyone to leave. I was stunned by the stench of whisky in her breath at such an early hour of the day. “How could the first lady be so drunk at that time? I stayed back to watch the ceremony till the end and left with my dignity intact.”
