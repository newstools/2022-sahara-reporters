The National Leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Ahmed Bola Tinubu is currently holding a meeting with the APC caucus in the Senate. The meeting with the former Lagos governor and presidential aspirant was announced earlier on Wednesday at plenary.  Tinubu arrived at the National Assembly complex around 2.30 pm in a convoy of vehicles for the meeting. Incidentally, Tinubu is a former senator and his wife, Oluremi is currently a senator and has held the office since 2011. After months of speculation, Tinubu in January formally declared his intention to run for President in 2023. He disclosed to journalists after a closed-door meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari in Abuja that he had just informed the President about his intention to succeed him in 2023. Mr Tinubu said it had been his age-long ambition to lead Nigeria one day. “I have informed the President of my ambition but I have not informed Nigerians yet, I am still consulting. And I have no problem consulting. And I’ve not set a parameter of limitation to the extent of how many people I will consult. “You will soon hear. All you want to hear is the categorical declaration. You’ve gotten that truth from me that I have informed Mr President of my ambition, and you don’t expect more answers than that,” he said. Like Buhari, who has been travelling abroad regularly for medical treatment, Tinubu’s health has been failing and he has also been going junketing abroad for treatment.
