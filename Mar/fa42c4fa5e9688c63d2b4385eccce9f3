The government of Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced a new ceasefire. Russia said the ceasefire will start at 10am Moscow time (9 a.m. Ukrainian/2 a.m. ET) Wednesday.  As the war enters its 13th day, Russia declared its readiness to provide evacuation corridors from Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol, along with other towns agreed with Ukraine during negotiations. CNN said that Russian media reported the ceasefire parameters, quoting the Coordination Headquarters for Humanitarian Response in Ukraine. However, the Russian side said there is the need for a continuous communication channel with Ukraine to exchange information regarding the evacuation of civilians and foreigners. Meanwhile, in a response to Russia’s new ceasefire announcement, the Ukrainian Armed Forces said that the occupiers cannot be trusted. In a Telegram post, the Armed Forces said that “Russia will request that Ukraine agree on the routes and opening hours of humanitarian corridors and notify representatives of foreign embassies, the UN, the OSCE, and the Red Cross by 02:00 in Kyiv on March 9.” But it added: “It is difficult to trust the occupier.”
