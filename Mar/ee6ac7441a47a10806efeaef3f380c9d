Some residents of Borno on Friday rescued a young truck pusher from being assaulted by soldier of the Nigerian Army after the boy mistakenly hit their vehicle at the popular Monday Market in Maiduguri.  In a trending video, some traders and members of the public were seen soliciting for donations to repair the army vehicle hit by the truck pusher as insisted by the soldier.  In the video clip, the boy was seen seated at the back of the army Hilux vehicle parked on the busy Monday Market road which is under construction, along with some bags of rice while donations were being made by members of the public to rescue him.  “This boy inside the vehicle has been arrested by the soldier driving this army vehicle that he hit his car.  “The boy mistakenly hit the vehicle while trying to maneuver past the busy road with his truck which is loaded with goods. The soldier arrested him and insisted the boy must repair his vehicle for him.  “We don’t want the boy to be taken to the barracks that is why we are making donations to pay the soldier since the boy cannot afford to pay him,” one of the contributors explained in the video.
