A Nigerian Army personnel identified only as Peter has died days after he was shot by operatives of the Department of State Services in the Lekki area of Lagos State.According to eyewitnesses, Peter was stopped by the DSS operatives and he had attempted to bring out his identity card to show that he belonged to the Nigerian Army — an action that cost him his life. A Twitter user, @_Candor wrote, “I lost a brother today. He was a Soldier. No, Boko Haram didn’t kill him, Bandits didn’t. He didn’t die at the war front. He was shot in the stomach by DSS in Lekki when he attempted to bring out his ID card.“Again, Nigeria failed its own. My God #Justice For Peter. He was so full of life. An amazing soul to the core. He was always smiling. I can’t process the fact that I won’t see him ever again. Living in Nigeria is equivalent to walking on a time bomb set to explode the next minute."https://twitter.com/_Candor/status/1500818748470710277?t=abihcfxhufktqJ_FRWlTAg&s=19Giving further explanation, a friend wrote, “Peter was killed by DSS.

Not even at the battlegrounds where he fought and conquered but on the street."
