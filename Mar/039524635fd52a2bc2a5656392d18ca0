A Russian soldier has revealed in his last text messages before his death, how they were bombing cities and also targeting civilians in the ongoing war in Ukraine. The revelation was made in the final text messages the Russian soldier sent to his mother, according to Daily Star 





The horrifying text messages were read by Ukraine's ambassador to the United Nations on Monday. "Mom, I'm no longer in Crimea," the soldier texted. "I'm not in training sessions." His mother replies: "Where are you then? Papa is asking whether I can send you a parcel." "What kind of a parcel mama can you send me," he responds. "What are you talking about? What happened?" his mum says. "Mama, I'm in Ukraine," he replies back. "There is a real war raging here. I'm afraid. We are bombing all of the cities together, even targeting civilians.“We were told that they would welcome us and they are falling under our armoured vehicles, throwing themselves under the wheels and not allowing us to pass. "They call us fascists. Mama. This is so hard." The Ukrainian ambassador said that the last message was sent just "moments" before the soldier lost his life. A dramatic video emerged online showing brave Ukrainians launching Molotov cocktails at a Russian armoured vehicle in a surprise drive-by attack.  It comes after the country's defence ministry encouraged residents to make petrol bombs to "neutralise the occupier". The clip, which has been widely shared on social media, sees at least two civilians hurling homemade explosives at the moving Russian troops.
