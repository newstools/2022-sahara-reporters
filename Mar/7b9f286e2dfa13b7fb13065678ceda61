One of the umbrella bodies of Nigerian youths, the Nigerian Youth Union (NYU), has frowned at the dilly-dallying on the gender inclusion bills by the National Assembly, declaring that youths and women bodies must sustain collective action over the bills.NYU regretted that the 9th National Assembly had to vote against progressive legislation whichi would bring Nigerian womenfolk to socio-political limelight and global harmony.The NYU National President, Chinonso Obasi, stated this while alluding to top ranking Nigerian women in international affairs such as Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala’s who is the Director-General of the World Trade Organisation.While offering to work together with Nigerian women to change the narrative in the country’s current democratic system, the NYU leader remarked that since evil men conspired to sustain the policy of exclusion, Nigeria women and youth would combine to change the narratives to enthrone a better governance system.Obasi, who is former President of the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) disclosed that in the course of its planned interface with political parties towards the 2023 general election, NYU would challenge parties on the number of spaces they created for youths and women.He said, “This is going to be the irreducible minimum demand to support any political party and to demonstrate our resolve to determine the direction of the 2023 general elections. We should insist on twining for most elective and appointive offices, which would join women and youths.“In Local Government councils, we want to see a situation whereby the position of chairman and deputy chairman would be peopled with men and women/youths. The demand for 35 per cent of elected and appointive public officials would be pursued with every sense of responsibility and determination.”The NYU President disclosed that NYU would embark on a tour of the 774 local government areas of the country to drum support for its programmes and support massive voter enlightenment and mobilisation for voter registration and the need to vote en masse at elections.
