Edo-Ojo Owen, a medical doctor, is currently admitted to the hospital after a nasty ordeal with unidentified naval officers at Lekki, Lagos. According to Owen, the incident happened on Saturday when he parked his vehicle at Freedom Park in Lekki.  Owen told FIJ that some naval officers knocked on his door and asked him to alight from the car. He said as he tried to ask if the parking lot was the wrong place for him to park, they became violent. “I asked them if I was not at the right parking lot. Instead of explaining, one officer started hitting my car. I alighted from my car to ask why he was hitting my car, but he punched me,” Owen said. He further noted that he fought back with one of them, but bystanders separated them. Next, he said, the officer brought out a knife and cut him. “He stabbed me in my hand, neck, and arm. After that, I ran to Fred, my friend’s house. He suggested that we go to the police station, but the policemen said it was too late. They said they could not mobilise a car at that moment.” However, after paying a bribe of N30,000 to the police officers, they agreed to follow them to the scene. This was around 7:30 pm. Owen said one of the police officers knocked on the gate on getting to where the naval officer stabbed him. He stated that a man in military camouflage came out and shot at the gate. “At this time, I was already bleeding heavily. The man who shot me was the one who harassed me in the afternoon. I managed to crawl to a private hospital to take care of myself. My family came to pick me up and I was taken to the place where I work for treatment,” he narrated
