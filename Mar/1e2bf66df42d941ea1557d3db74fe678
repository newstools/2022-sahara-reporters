The Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, has urged police officers to pray for their salaries to be paid at the end of the month. While delivering a lecture at the Force Headquarters in Abuja on Thursday, Baba suggested that prayers by police officers may fast-track the implementation of the new salary structure by March ending. IGP Usman Baba Alkali He also informed members that the new salary may be paid at the end of this month. "Everyone should exercise patience and pray,” he was quoted as saying by Peoples Gazette. This comes amid reports of a planned protest and strike by junior officers of the force scheduled for March 26. Although the acting force public relations officer, Muyiwa Adejobi, had debunked the report describing it as “fake news”, there are strong indications that the junior officers would embark on strike on the said date. The officers listed unpaid emoluments, outdated weapons, poor working conditions among other reasons for the planned protest. In a desperately veiled attempt to placate the disgruntled officers and quell strike agitations, IGP offered to waive tax for all serving officers effective April 2022. “The Inspector-General of Police in his magnanimity has also ensured that all serving personnel be exempted from the payment of tax, with effect from April 2022,” reads the outcome of Baba’s lecture. Similarly, the IGP assured officers he was “working tirelessly” to ensure that “both serving and retired members of the Force are removed from the contributory pension scheme”. Despite these promises, the new salary structure remains a huge probability with the IGP asking officers to pray for its implementation.
