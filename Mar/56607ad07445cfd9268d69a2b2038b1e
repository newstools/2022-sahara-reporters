The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA has alleged that suspended Deputy Police Commissioner (DCP), Abba Kyari, plans to escape from Nigeria.NDLEA raised the alarm on Monday while urging an Abuja Federal High Court not to grant Kyari bail. Counsel for the suspended officer, Kanu Agabi, had filed an application for bail adding that the defendants were entitled to bail because it was a bailable offence.He argued that the decision of the prosecution to review the facts against the defendants was unnecessary, noting that it would amount to prejudice if the allegation preferred against the defendants turn out to be false.However, NDLEA said the suspended police officer planned to flee Nigeria to avoid facing punishment for his crimes.The Director, Prosecution and Legal Services, Joseph Sunday, stated this while adopting the counter-affidavit before Justice Emeka Nwite.In the 21-paragraph counter-affidavit, the NDLEA argued that Kyari would “escape and has the capacity to interfere with witnesses.”The presiding judge after listening to the arguments of the parties involved in the case adjourned the matter to March 14 to enable the parties to file and exchange the necessary processes regarding the matter.NDLEA had accused Kyari and the four other police officers of conspiracy, obstruction and dealing in cocaine worth 17.55 kilogrammes.It also alleged that Kyari and his men unlawfully tampered with 21.25kg worth of cocaine.Kyari had also been accused of committing wire fraud, money laundering and identity theft.He was also accused of working with Ramon Abbas, aka Hushpuppi, who has pleaded guilty to internet fraud.A grand jury in April 2021 filed an indictment against Kyari with the approval of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.
