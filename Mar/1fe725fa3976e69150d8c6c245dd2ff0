Gunmen have attacked and razed Okwelle Divisional Police Headquarters situated in the Onuimo Local Government Area of Imo State. According to Punch, the hoodlums struck midnight when there was no police officer on duty.  An indigene of the area said the attack had caused an uneasy calm in the area. The recent attack came just one week after some gunmen attacked Isu Divisional Police Headquarters and killed two policemen on duty. A village source, who preferred anonymity, said, “The policemen usually leave the station every night and reopen it in the morning. We learnt that they sleep in another station. Last night, hoodlums stormed there and set it ablaze. This is about the only functional police station around here and it has been set on fire. This is highly unfortunate.” When contacted, the spokesperson for the Command, Micheal Abattam, confirmed the attack, but added that there was no casualty.
