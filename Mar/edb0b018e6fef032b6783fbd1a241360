The decision was made following President Vladimir Putin’s decision to launch military operations in Ukraine, the world football body said. FIFA Russia’s opponents, Poland, have been given a bye into the Path B playoff final on March 29. Poland had been due to face Russia in the semi-final of the playoff process days earlier.
