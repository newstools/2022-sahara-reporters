Oyo State chapter of All Progressives Congress (APC), on Friday, split into two and one of the factions inaugurated its chairman, Abu Gbadamosi. This comes amid the crisis rocking the state chapter of the APC.  Last October, the state chapter of the party elected a former commissioner, Ajiboye Omodewu as Chairman, but some party members were not happy with the choice. The new faction has sworn in Gbadamosi, meaning the party now has two factional chairmen in the state. Gbadamosi was sworn in at the Trans Amusement Park in Ibadan, the state capital. Some of the leaders of the party who asked not to be named confirmed the development to Daily Post on Friday. One of them said, “Don’t quote me. It is not far from the truth. They are doing it to let the national party know that Oyo APC is not settled yet. “As you said, don’t quote me. I think it is not impossible. It is not peculiar to Oyo state. That is the fact.” Meanwhile, the inauguration of the factional chairman comes a few hours before the national convention of the party. The APC national convention has been slated to hold on Saturday in Abuja.
