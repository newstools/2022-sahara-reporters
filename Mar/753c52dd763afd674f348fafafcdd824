An FCT High Court has issued an order vacating the restraining injunction against the March 26 convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The APC had slated March 26 for its national convention where it will elect leaders into key national offices of the party. File Photo However, shortly after necessary committees for the convention were set up, an order restraining the party from going ahead with the planned convention surfaced. The restraining order was issued on November 18, 2021, by Justice Bello Kawu of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court. The suit, filed by one Salisu Umoru at the court had the APC, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and Buni as respondents. “That the 1st Defendant/Respondent can only conduct its national convention after the hearing and determination of the substantive suit pending before this honourable court,” the court order seen by SaharaReporters reads. “That in the interest of justice accelerated hearing of the substantive suit is hereby ordered. “That this matter is hereby adjourned to the 10th day of January 2022 for hearing of the substantive suit at High Court No. 15, Kubwa, FCT-Abuja.” However, Justice Kawu on Friday held that a member of a political party cannot sue the party. He said the order of November 18, 2021, has been overtaken by a recent Supreme Court judgement on a similar matter. The court fixed March 30 for the substantive suit.
