Omininikoron was arrested after the family of the 22-year-old fashion designer declared her missing on February 27. Bamise reportedly boarded a BRT vehicle from Chevron Bus Stop, Ajah to Oshodi around 7 pm on February 26. During the journey, the fashion designer was said to have observed that the driver was not picking up other passengers at subsequent bus stops along the route. Disturbed, she messaged her friend and sent voice notes detailing her predicament. It was the last time her friend and family members heard from her and she was later declared missing. On Monday, she was found dead on Carter Bridge, according to the Lagos State Police Command. The police subsequently picked up the bus driver, Nice Andrew Omininikoron, who has since remained in their custody.
