A High Court sitting in Abeokuta, Ogun State, has sentenced a suspect, Ibrahim Kolade, to death by hanging for armed robbery.The suspect, who was accused of stealing phones and money, was convicted on a two-count charge of conspiracy and armed robbery. Justice Ayokunle Rotimi-Balogun, while delivering the judgment, ruled that all the evidence presented by the prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt that the convict was guilty as charged.He noted that having found the defendant guilty as charged, he would die by hanging.The Prosecuting Senior State Counsel, Mrs Oluwabunmi Akinola, had earlier told the court that Kolade committed the offences on December 2, 2013, at Obantoko Area in Abeokuta.She explained that Kolade conspired with one other person still at large and robbed three persons of their phones and money at different locations on the day of the crime.According to Mrs Akinola, the suspect used a motorcycle and armed with offensive weapons to rob one Mrs Ayelabola Oluwatosin of N80,000 and two phones while she was returning from her shop.“On the same day, he went to the shop of one Mrs Olaotan Abisola, threatened her with a stick and cutlass and robbed her of her LG phone and N20,000 cash.“Luck ran out on him, however, when he robbed one Miss Damilola Johnson, a student, of her Nokia phone, while she was walking home. The victim raised the alarm and people around ran after the motorcycle and Kolade was apprehended,” the prosecutor narrated.The offence contravened the Robbery and Firearms (Special Provisions) Act of the Federation of Nigeria 2004, Akinola noted.
