The statement reads, “This is to alert the general public and entire world that another genocide is about to happen in Ihiala LGA, Nnewi South of Anambra State and Orlu LGA, Orsu LGA, Oru West and East in Imo State by Nigeria Government security agencies. Nigerian military is circling these communities and cities to invade for the possible elimination of Biafrans. “IPOB warns politicians in the region that if any soul is lost in any community and LGAs we have them to contend with. “We are reliably informed that a few governors in the region joined the Nigerian Army and security apparatus to commit this genocide against our people and help them in perfecting the killing of their people and they should and must retrace their steps because it will not succeed with their evil plots against the people of Biafra. The details will come tomorrow.“The governors should not allow any soul to be lost unjustly this time around. We are putting the whole world on notice of this criminal preparation to commit genocide against innocent citizens of these communities and Biafra.”
