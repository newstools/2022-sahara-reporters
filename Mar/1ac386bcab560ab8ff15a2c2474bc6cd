UK Telegraph He had posted a poster on Facebook which had a picture of Putin with the text - "Wanted Dead Or Alive. Vladimir Putin For Mass Murder." The poster however was banned and deleted from the social media website, India Times reports. He had also urged the country’s military officers to bring him to justice for allegedly committing “war crimes” in his invasion of Ukraine. He shared another post with the text, "I promise to pay $1,000,000 to the officer(s) who, complying with their constitutional duty, arrest(s) Putin as a war criminal under Russian and international laws. Putin is not the Russian president as he came to power as the result of a special operation of blowing up apartment buildings in Russia, then violated the Constitution by eliminating free elections and murdering his opponents." According to Business Insider, Konanykhin also said that the money from the bounty will come from his own funds so that it is verified that the military assault on Ukraine is not being conducted in his name. "If enough other people make similar statements, it may increase the chances of Putin getting arrested and brought to justice," he added. However, after the millionaire's post got viral, he clarified what he actually meant in another post. He wrote, "Some reports suggest that I promised to pay for the assassination of Putin. It is NOT correct. While such an outcome would be cheered by millions of people around the world, I believe that Putin must be brought to justice."
