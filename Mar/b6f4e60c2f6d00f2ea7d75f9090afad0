The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has advised Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State to swallow his pride and pay more attention to putting a stop to the ravaging insecurity in the state.The body further condemned what it described as the government’s rhetorical responses on the media to the incessant killings recorded in the state in recent times without concrete action taken to protect the lives and property of citizens. The position of the body was made known in a statement issued by the CAN Chairman, Kaduna State Chapter, Reverend John Joseph Hayab.The statement comes on the heels of the breakdown of law and order in the southern part of the state.CAN, however, urged civilians in the state to be vigilant.He said, “How long will this evil continue and when will our leaders act dutifully?  Kaduna State citizens are tired of government’s rhetorical responses without concrete action taken to protect lives and property.“Accordingly, we want to hear and see the killers and kidnappers arrested as the government’s usual media condemnation whenever there is havoc is not good enough.“Meanwhile, we appeal to citizens to also wake up and do the needful, protecting their lives and community. When a government fails to protect you, you ought to find a means of defending yourself.“For the records, Kaduna State has lost several lives in the past four years while the leaders scarcely show empathy or concern for the victims seeing that the government’s response is usually in the media. Sadly, the dead cannot read nor listen to the news.“Then of what use is media condemnation? CAN, therefore, calls on the Kaduna State Government to swallow her pride and accept that she has failed the people, genuinely seeking help to immediately halt the wanton killings, kidnappings, and terrorist activities going on in the state.“Governor El-rufai and his team should focus on the fight to salvage the state so that he will be remembered for good when he leaves office.”
