But the defence counsel, Lawrence Imolode, prayed the court to take custody of the defendants instead of remanding them at the correctional center.  The defence counsel argued that the offence is bailable and the defendants were not a flight risk.  Imolode further informed the court that one of the defendants was a former military administrator in Nigeria and another is a regional bank manager, and therefore would not evade trial.  The defence lawyer also tendered his call to bar certificate in bid to reassure the court of producing the defendants for trial on the next adjourned date.  Justice Dada granted the prayers of the defence counsel and released all the defendants on bail.  The judge thereafter adjourned the matter till May 24 for trial.
