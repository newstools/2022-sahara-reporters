Nnamdi Kanu, detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), has narrated how he was tortured, maltreated, chained and confined to a location without being told the reason for his arrest or shown any warrant of arrest in Republic of Kenya by the secret agent. Kanu made this known in a letter written by special counsel, Aloy Ejimakor to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN), dated March 20, giving clue on his arrest in Kenya before being brought to the country.  According to the letter, the lawyer revealed that Kanu entered into Republic of Kenya with a British passport on May 12, 2021 and later settled down temporary in the country. The lawyer explained that Kalu on June 19, 2021 drove to Jomo Kenyatta Airport on personal errand and in attempt to pull over at the parking lot of the airport, he was allegedly accosted by about 20 armed men who handcuffed him, covered his face and bundled him into their vehicle to an unknown destination. He alleged that his client was maltreated, chained, tortured for eight days and confined to a location without being told the reason for his arrest or shown any warrant of arrest, before being smuggled to Nigeria. On October 14, 2015, Kanu was arrested on 11 count charge bordering on terrorism, treasonable felony, managing an unlawful society, publication of defamatory matter, illegal possession of firearms and improper importation of goods, among others. Kanu’s bail that was granted him on health grounds was revoked by a court sitting in Abuja and issued a bench warrant for his arrest on the same date, over his failure to appear in court for hearing.
