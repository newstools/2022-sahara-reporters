The legal team of human rights’ activist, Omoyele Sowore, on Friday asked the Police Service Commission to sanction the over-zealous police officers involved in the illegal arrest of Barrister Abubakar Marshal, a senior lawyer in the Falana & Falana Chambers. Marshal, a senior lawyer in Falana & Falana Chambers, had earlier been arrested by policemen who laid siege to his residence, in connection with a suit that was filed against the police during the week. The suit is asking the court to declare as illegal the arrest of Sowore on the 24th of February 2022, as it was arbitrariness taken too far.The legal team, in a letter signed by Tope Temokun after Marshal's arrest, called on the police to stop embarrassing the country with untidy and disgraceful unprofessional attitude.The team affirmed that they shall not be tired to challenge rascality and abuse of powers by the police and other law enforcement agents until Nigeria was free."It will be recalled that on the 24th of February 2022, Omoyele Sowore  was arrested within the precincts of the Court of Appeal, Abuja, by officers of the Nigerian police over publications allegedly made by Sahara Reporters, a legal entity, separate and distinct from Omoyele Sowore, which in consequence amounts to a breach of Omoyele Sowore’s right to personal liberty and freedom of movement as guaranteed under Sections 35(1) and 41(1) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (As Amended)."On the 1st of March 2022, we, on behalf of Omoyele Sowore, filed and served on the police, processes of court asking the court to declare illegal Sowore's arrest, while asking for an injunction stopping the police from further violating his rights in relation to the subject-matter of this case,” Temokun said.He said, "Among the lawyers who took out this court process was the vibrant and irrepressible Barrister Abubakar Marshal, joining other advocates of the people to sue the police for this serial infraction and rape of the Constitution on the instigation of one acclaimed billionaire."The police laid siege on Marshal’s home this morning because, instead of toeing the path of honour to wait for the court to pronounce on the legality of the arrest to vindicate them. The result is the arrest of Marshal this morning."While we condemn this arbitrariness and call on the police to stop embarrassing the country with this kind of untidy and disgraceful unprofessional attitude, we call on the Police Service Commission to sanction the over-zealous police officers involved in this rascally act."We shall not be tired to challenge rascality and abuse of powers by the police and other law enforcement agents until Nigeria is free."
