The House of Representatives Committee on Public Accounts Tuesday directed the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Ltd, Mele Kyari, to produce heads of subsidiaries mentioned in the various audit queries by the Office of the Auditor-General for the Federation. The NNPC management, led by the Chief Financial Officer, Umar Ajiya, who represented Kyari, appeared before the committee over the audit queries.  The chairman of the committee, Oluwole Oke, alleged that the NNPC was shielding its subsidiaries from honouring summons by the committee on audit queries raised against them over violations of various financial regulations over the years. He said the committee had resolved to extract the entire queries from the audit reports and publish them in national dailies for the general public and the presidency to see how those in charge of the NNPC and its subsidiaries were running them. Responding, Ajiya said the NNPC would never have any reason to shield heads of its subsidiaries. SaharaReporters had on Tuesday reported that the NNPC failed to account for about 107,239,436 barrels of crude oil lifted for domestic consumption in 2019, according to records from the office of the Auditor-General for the Federation (AuGF). This was contained in the "Federal Government of Nigeria consolidated financial statements" for the year ended December 31, 2019, submitted to the clerk to the National Assembly via a letter dated August 18, 2021, and signed by the Auditor General, Adolphus Aghughu. In a similar vein, performance report of two depots shows that about 22,929.84 litres of PMS valued at N7.06 billion pumped to the two depots (Ibadan-Ilorin and Aba-Enugu) between June and July 2019 were not received by the depots. According to the report, there were discrepancies between the amounts reported by the NNPC as transfer to the federations account and what was reported by the AuGF. While the NNPC records showed that N1,272,606,864,000.00 was transferred by the corporation, the amount recorded by the Accountant General for the federation was N608,710,292,773.44, showing a discrepancy of N663,896,567,227.58. The AuGF said the Group Managing Director of the NNPC should be asked to explain the discrepancy between the two figures and remit the balance of N663,896,567,227.58 to the federation account or face sanctions. Also, the sum of N519,922,433,918.46 was transferred to the federation account by the NNPC based on transfer mandates, while demanding that the company provide “reconciliation statement for the difference of N88, 787, 862, 853.96 between SGF’s figure of N608, 710, 296, 772.42 and NNPC’s figure per transfer mandate of N519, 922, 433, 918.46.”
