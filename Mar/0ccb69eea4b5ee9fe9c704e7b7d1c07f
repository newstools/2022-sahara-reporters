Russia on Saturday described the United States and European Union as “economic bandits” following the economic sanctions against the country amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Kremlin Press Secretary, Dmitry Peskov, threatened that Russia would respond to the “economic banditry” though he did not specify the nature of the response, according to a report by Reuters. He noted that Russia was a big country that cannot be isolated from the world. “This does not mean Russia is isolated. The world is too big for Europe and America to isolate a country, and even more so a country as big as Russia. There are many more countries in the world,” Psekov said. Russia embarked on a war with Ukraine last week Thursday, a development that has been globally condemned with several countries and organisations imposing heavy sanctions on it. The U.S. has also considered freezing the $643billion in reserves of the Russian Central Bank amassed by Putin, and freezing assets of Russian oligarchs.
