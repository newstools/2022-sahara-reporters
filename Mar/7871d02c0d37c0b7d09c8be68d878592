A notorious bandit, Bello Turji, has explained why it may be difficult for the government to curtail banditry in the country. Turji, who had become a terror in the North-West, said since the Nigerian Government cannot prevent illegal firearms in circulation, nobody can prevent bandits from buying petrol. He stated this in reference to the restrictions placed in September last year in Zamfara to curb the activities of the bandits in the state.He spoke in an interview with Trust TV as part of a documentary, tagged ‘Nigeria’s Banditry: The Inside Story’.Recall that the Nigerian Communications Commission had mandated all telecommunication operators in the country to stop extending services to Zamfara and its environs.During the restriction, many bandits’ leaders and their foot soldiers were reported to have been killed during raids in Zamfara State.Turji said, “It is not right to deny Fulani entry into Shinkafi; it’s a local government for all citizens. If you deny Fulani entry, where are they supposed to go?“If you buy just a measure of maize, they confiscate it; or if you buy a loaf of bread they will say you are buying it for Turji. Is it only Turji who eats out of all the people here?“Let me ask you; isn’t this a gun? Is it those who failed to prevent the circulation of arms in Nigeria that will prevent us from buying petrol, which even a little kid knows where it can be obtained?”
