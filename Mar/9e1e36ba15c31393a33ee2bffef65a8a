The Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, has summoned to Abuja, Yahaya Abubakar, the police orderly in a viral video holding a plate of food for his “madam”, Ambassador Nimota Akanbi.He is to report to the Force Headquarters, Abuja. Acting Force Public Relations Officer, Muyiwa Adejobi disclosed this on Wednesday. Adejobi warned police officers attached to Very Important Persons all over the country to stop serving purposes other than protecting them from security threats.“We have seen the policeman. We will investigate the scene and act accordingly.  Such an act is condemned. However, the policeman will be in Abuja for us to get more facts about the ugly incident as we are determined to curb such. We will update you as at when due,” Adejobi said.A viral video has shown Abubakar, a constable carrying a plate of food behind the Akanbi, who is the chairman of the National Senior Secondary Education Commission (NSSEC) and former Nigeria’s Ambassador to the Netherlands.The event was a society function in Kwara State where guests were treated to a lavish buffet of dishes. Many Nigerians on social media expressed disgust at the manner police officers willingly offered themselves to be used by the rich, while remarking that such a scenario brings disrespect to the force. They also faulted the top echelon of the force for prioritising the security of a few wealthy people while the poor masses who are in need of protection from robbers and criminals are left unattended. Last week, a policeman, Sergeant Adeleke Ogunsola, died after being hit by an unnamed driver of a former Ogun State Governor, Gbenga Daniel. The incident happened at Daniel’s residence at Sagamu in Ogun. Many cops also expressed sadness that Ogunsola, an orderly, was turned to a gatekeeper at the house.
