Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich has offered to sell the club to Swiss billionaire, Hansjorg Wyss and is demanding in excess of £2billon. The 55-year-old Russian oligarch has been under the spotlight due to his alleged ties with Russian President, Vladimir Putin.  U.S President, Joe Biden, during his broadcast on Thursday, vowed that the West would seize everything that belonged to Russian Oligarchs, including their apartments. Abramovich has strongly denied any links to the Russian President, but calls for his sanction keep getting louder. Wyss, who is reported to have a personal net worth of $5.8billion, says it is the Russian who is trying to engineer an auction, not the other way around. Speaking to Swiss newspaper, Blick, the 85-year-old said: “Abramovich is one of Putin’s closest advisers and friends. Like all other oligarchs, he is also in a state of panic. “Abramovich is trying to sell all his properties in England. He also wants to get rid of Chelsea quickly. I and three other people received an offer on Tuesday to buy Chelsea from Abramovich.” Wyss, however, said that the Russian billionaire businessman had placed the price for the club so high, adding that he had to wait to see what happened in the next four or five days. “You know Chelsea owe him £2billion? But Chelsea has no money, which means that whoever buys Chelsea has to compensate Abramovich,” he added.
