“The Governor of Niger revealed that terrorists occupy 12 of the 25 Local Governments in the state. Niger is a state that neighbours the Federal Capital. What additional proof is needed that bandits have become the fourth tier of Government?” Sani-Bello had said during a recent visit to the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) at the Central Primary School, Gwada recently that bandits had taken over 12 local government areas in his state. He also said no fewer than seven communities had been submerged by flooding in the Shiroro LGA due to the ongoing construction of the Zungeru hydro-electric power station in the state. Sympathising with the displaced persons, Sani-Bello said, “We have almost 4,000 IDPs displaced by banditry and the construction of Zungeru dam.”He also noted that “some communities have been flooded and are underwater and have left, while they have not been paid compensation”.He lamented the “influx of bandits and Boko Haram elements in and out of Shiroro Local Government Area,” adding, “They have continued to detonate improvised explosive devices in Galadima-Kogo.” The governor noted that about 12 local government areas in the state were being occupied by bandits, adding that security agencies were using new tactics and strategies to neutralise them. He said the bandits are taking advantage of the size of the state and the inadequate number of security officers on the ground.
