At least two persons have been killed by gunmen suspected to be bandits in Mai Bakko village, Sabuwa Local Government Area of Katsina State. Residents told SaharaReporters that the terrorists locally known as bandits stormed the village Tuesday morning when people were preparing for prayer and they operated for many hours.  It was learnt that on arrival at the village on motorcycles, "the gunmen started shooting indiscriminately, resulting in the death of the victims." The gunmen also abducted a yet-to-be-ascertained number of people. Katsina, despite being the home state of President Muhammadu Buhari, has witnessed sporadic attacks by bandits and kidnappers that have claimed the lives of many. Over 700 people have been reportedly killed by the gunmen in Jibia, Kankara, Dutsinma, Musawa, Danmusa and Safana local government areas of the state in the last five months. On December 11, 2020, some bandits kidnapped 344 students of Government Science Secondary School, Kankara. They were released about a week later. Also on December 19, 84 Islamiyya students of Hizburrahim Islamiyya in Mahuta village, Dandume Local Government Area of the state were abducted but rescued shortly after.
