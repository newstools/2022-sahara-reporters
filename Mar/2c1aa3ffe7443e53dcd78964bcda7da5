The Oyo State Government, on Tuesday, ordered the immediate closure of Oke-Ogun College of Management Sciences and Technology, Iseyin. The Commissioner for Education, Science and Technology, Rahman Abiodun Abdu-Raheem, said the school was shut down for non-compliance with registration procedures. 





The Commissioner for Education, Science and Technology, Rahman Abiodun Abdu-Raheem, said the school was shut down for non-compliance with registration procedures.This was disclosed in a statement e-signed by Wasiu Olatunbosun, the state Commissioner for Information, Culture and Tourism.Some indigenes of the town, under the aegis of ‘Ebedi Frontliner’, had petitioned the state government; Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu; and the National Board for Technical Education, asserting that the institution was neither registered nor accredited for students’ enrolment among other allegations.Abdu-Raheem, while sealing off the college, urged proprietors of schools to always do the needful, in their quests to establish schools.He said this will avoid unnecessary embarrassment for both the state and the proprietors.Abdu-Raheem, last month, invited and directed the Proprietor of the College, Mr. Adewale Owoseni to remove all billboards with the inscriptions of the school until the needful was done.The commissioner, therefore, affirmed the state government’s commitment to ensure due process is followed in all its affairs.
