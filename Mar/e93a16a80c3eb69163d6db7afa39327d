Fifteen-year-old Tola Demurin is currently being detained by the management of the General Hospital, Ikeja over the inability of his family to clear his hospital bills. Demurin, who was admitted to the hospital after he sustained injuries on his chest, said he was operated upon and discharged but was not allowed to go home as his family still owed N265,000 out of the initial N540,000 hospital bill. The teenager and his grandmother have remained in the hospital since then. He said, “My name is Tola Demurin, I'm 15 years old, I am in Senior Secondary School 2. I have been here for three months now. I did an operation on my chest and neck, I asked what happened to me, they said it was chest fluid and how did it happen? I was in school that day, the principal was coming so we were running away from him. We were many, so I hit my chest on the staircase. I was at home, it got swollen, they quickly rushed me down here. “I've been here for three months, I got medical care here, I was placed on oxygen. I have even been discharged but not allowed to go yet because we still owe them N265,000. The initial bill was N540,000. People helped us with money to pay the N275,000."
