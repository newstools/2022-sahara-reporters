A short video of former Anambra Governor Willie Obiano in the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission’s detention facility has surfaced online.In the 12-second video, Obiano was seen drinking water from a bottle and discussing with an unidentified person seated beside him. The EFCC said Obiano is being quizzed over the alleged misappropriation of N42 billion belonging to the state.The agency had last year placed the former governor on its watch list and also asked the Nigerian Immigration Service to stop him from leaving the country in a letter to the Comptroller-General of Immigration, dated November 15, 2021.Obiano was arrested by the EFCC on Thursday night, hours after handing over to the new Anambra Governor, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo.The EFCC spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren, later said, “Obiano has been flown to Abuja (on Friday). He is currently at our Abuja office.“Obiano was arrested for alleged misappropriation of public funds, including, N5bn Sure-P and N37bn security vote which was withdrawn in cash. Part of the funds was also allegedly diverted to finance political activities in the state.”Meanwhile, the All Progressives Grand Alliance has condemned Obiano’s arrest. The party described the arrest of the former governor as a “politically-motivated witch-hunt”, saying the EFCC had resorted to the use of fifth columnists.Addressing journalists in Awka, on Saturday, the National Coordinator, APGA Media Warriors Forum, Chinedu Obigwe, said the allegation that the former governor misappropriated N42bn, out of which N37bn was used to fund political activities was baseless. Obigwe said efforts by the EFCC to dent the reputation of Obiano would not succeed, insisting that he is innocent until proven guilty by a competent court of law.He said Nigerians don’t have confidence in the anti-graft agency anymore, saying “when they (EFCC) see the real corrupt politicians joining APC, they would turn to toothless bulldogs.”    https://www.instagram.com/tv/CbUaWPWOHHf/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading
