An Area Court sitting in Kabusa in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja has ordered the remand of Abubakar Marshal, a lawyer to human rights’ activist, Omoyele Sowore, in Kuje Correctional Centre till Tuesday, March 8.Marshal was accused of filing a lawsuit on behalf of Sowore, who was illegally arrested on the trumped up allegation of defaming a former Member House of Representatives, Ned Nwoko. SaharaReporters earlier reported how overzealous policemen arrested Marshal in his home by armed policemen who were taking orders from Nwoko, who hurriedly took him to the court with a view to sending him to prison custody.Marshal who represented himself told the court that he is member of the legal profession and the Nigerian Bar Association and that he could not run away and that his International Passport had been taken away by the police.Marshal added that the defendant, Sowore, had never been invited by the police and that he made a formal declaration to run for President in 2023 on Tuesday but the police did arrest him; and that the defendant was not on the run.He also stated that the police had never invited his boss, Femi Falana, SAN.He therefore asked the court to grant him bail.The judge after he had listened to the submission said he was not convinced and he therefore ordered him to be remanded in Kuje prison till Tuesday, March 8, when he would rule on bail application.The judge, who was said to have been brought to court in a Mercedes Benz belonging to Ned Nwoko, orchestrated the whole arrangement.The judge was also accompanied by Ned Nwoko’s staff and supporters who thronged the court. Recall that Sowore had during the week filed a lawsuit against Nwoko and the Nigeria Police Force and demanded the sum of N200milion over his illegal arrest and detention last Thursday.
