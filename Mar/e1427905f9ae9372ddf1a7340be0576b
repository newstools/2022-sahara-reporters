The two four-year-old boys, Wasiu Dauda and Al-Ameen Ibrahim, abducted in the Ijesha area of Lagos have been found. According to Daily Trust, the two four-year-old boys, Wasiu Dauda and Al-Ameen Ibrahim, were found alive in an abandoned minibus along Oshodi-Apapa Expressway Sunday morning.  Dauda’s mother, Awau, said the children were receiving treatment at a hospital. “We have found them. They were found in an abandoned minibus this morning on the expressway. They are in the hospital now,” the elated mother said. SaharaReporters had earlier reported that the little boys were discovered missing around 4 pm on Friday, two hours after they returned from school. A man was said to have lured them into a tricycle with biscuits while they were playing in their area and whisked them away.
