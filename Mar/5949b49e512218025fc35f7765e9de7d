The last time we spoke, I told you that we were making arrangements to take him to the hospital; over his ill health. So, he was released based on health grounds.“I am to inform you that Chief Sunday Adeyemo has been released from prison to his medical practitioners under the agreement that he should not leave the medical centre or Cotonou for any reason.
