The Senate has rejected a request by President Muhammadu Buhari to amend section 84 (2) subsection 12 in the 2021 Electoral Act. President Buhari had on February 25 signed the Electoral Act Amendment Bill into law.  During the signing, he criticised the section, which he said “constitutes a disenfranchisement of serving political office holders”. Section 84(12) states that “No political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.” The President subsequently sent a formal request to the national assembly for it to delete the clause. But the lawmakers on Wednesday rejected the bill through a voice vote when it was tabled to be read a second time.
