The Chief Security Officer, Primero Transport Services Limited, a franchise holder of the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) buses, Cletus Okodolor, has explained why they suspended their activities for the day.In a chat with Daily Trust, Okodolor emphasised that the suspension of their activities was for a day in order not to create a burden for their customers. He said, “Due to the death of the young lady, Bamise, we decided to halt our activities just for today. It is the Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (LAMATA) that told us to pause our operation only for today. They are our regulators. The reason we paused our operation is because LAMATA are our regulators, also, if you are following us you know that they also want to protest today. Moreso, it is a way to mourn the deceased.”Emotions ran high on Monday when the corpse of 22-year-old Oluwabamise Ayanwole, who was allegedly abducted while travelling in a BRT vehicle, was found.The body of the deceased was allegedly dumped by her abductors on Carter Bridge before driving away in a BRT bus.SaharaReporters had reported that James Joel, a family member of the woman, said the police treated the young woman’s case with levity.Joel, who spoke during a press briefing on Tuesday, said Bamise's sister had gone to the police station on Sunday, February 27 to file a missing person's case but was brushed aside by police officers on duty.Shortly after her body was found on Monday, the police in Lagos revealed that the driver of the BRT vehicle, Nice Andrew Omininikoron, who went into hiding immediately after the incident, had been arrested.The spokesperson for the police in Lagos, Adekunle Ajisebutu, confirmed the arrest, adding that more details into the matter would be provided later.
