The Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola has ruled himself out of the 2023 Presidential race. Fashola stated this when he was asked by a journalist about his plans for the 2023 elections, a tweet from Tolu Ogunlesi, special assistant on digital/new media to President Muhammadu Buhari, noted. https://twitter.com/toluogunlesi/status/1506946385576353796?t=7HiWaVPfZVdhdsnXxA7nUQ&s=19This comes amid calls in certain quarters for Fashola to also contest for the President of Nigeria. In November 2021, a Southeast group, the Young Easterners for Progressive Governance (YEPG), threw its weight behind the former Lagos state governor, Fashola.The group, made up of young professionals and entrepreneurs from the Southeast zone of the country, noted that ordinarily, they would have preferred the Presidency to be zoned to the Southeast but the reality was that the Southwest was in the best position to take over from Buhari in 2023.But the minister had denied having any affiliation with the support groups. He has also noted that he is going back to his family after he leaves office as minister as he extends his best wishes to the current and prospective aspirants.
