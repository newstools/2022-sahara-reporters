The Movement of The People (MOP) a civic group, has stated that human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore, is the right man for the 2023 presidency as the country searches for a competent leader.Ayo Moses Ogedengbe, MOP communications strategist and member, said this in reaction to Sowore’s presidential declaration.

Last Tuesday, Sowore declared his interest to join the 2023 presidential race on the platform of the African Action Congress (AAC) in Abuja.Speaking on the development, Ogedengbe said the renowned activist was not only qualified for presidency but had consistently stood on the side of the oppressed people of our country.He said, “Let me say very clearly that Omoyele Sowore’s declaration is very much in line with his constitutional rights as a citizen of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.“I believe, personally, that the time has come for Nigerians to do away with the old, tired and expired political horses so as to effectively embrace the new pan African politics being driven by the new guys on the block.“Not only is Sowore qualified to be the next president should Nigerians rise to the occasion in search of a new horse, he is one who has consistently stood on the side of the oppressed people of our country.“And on that path, he shares a rare passion with very few other Nigerians like Seun Anikulapo-Kuti, who has resurrected The Movement of the People (MOP) in search of a revolutionary solution to the perennial problems of oppression that Nigerian peoples suffer in the hands of a kleptocratic political and economic elite.“Sowore may have his difference in political perspectives in terms of how to go about the revolution, but most of us, in line with the beliefs of our leader, Seun Anikulapo-Kuti, hold Sowore in high esteem.“The clear line of difference, for the avoidance of doubt, is that where Sowore appears to be seeking a top-bottom approach to the revolution, we at the MOP believe very strongly in the bottom-up approach.”Also speaking, Dennis Adikwuru, a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader in Imo State, described Sowere as an international figure who had good background and knowledge of the workings of the Nigerian polity.Adikwuru said, “Sowore is a critical mind on the misgivings in the governance of Nigeria and has confronted the leadership with a view to bringing about good democratic governance.”On his part, AAC National Publicity Secretary, Femi Adeyeye, hailed Sowore's vision to change the socio-political landscape in Nigeria.He told Sunday Independent: “Yes, I was there. One of the highlights of the day was how Omoyele Sowore, the aspirant, marshalled some of the programmes of the party one after the other.“He was able to inspire the audience towards working together to achieve the goal of having a prosperous country. And as you can see, the political temperature has changed, since the declaration.”At the event, Sowore had called on Nigerians to support him for a better country.“The Nigerian people cannot afford to lose another four years to cluelessness,” he had said.In the 2019 election, Sowore came fifth during the presidential election with 33,953 votes ahead of other new entrants like Fela Durotoye of the Alliance for New Nigeria (ANN), and Kingsley Moghalu of the Young Democratic Party (YPP).
