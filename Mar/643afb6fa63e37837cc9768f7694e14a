An Osun State High Court has refused the bail applications of Rahman Adedoyin, the Chairman of Hilton Hotel and Resorts and founder of Oduduwa University. Adedoyin and six others are being prosecuted for allegedly murdering a postgraduate student of the Obafemi Awolowo University, Timothy Adegoke.  Delivering the ruling on Monday morning, the Osun State Chief Justice, Justice Adepele Ojo declined to grant the application on health grounds, as filed by the counsel for the defendant, Kunle Adegoke. Ojo based her refusal on the fact that the correctional centre has the facilities to cater for the health needs of Adedoyin since his health condition is not too serious. Adegoke had lodged in Hilton Hotels and Resorts at Ile-Ife upon his arrival from Abuja on November 5 to enable him to arrive early for his examination at the OAU Distance Learning Centre, Moro, Osun State, on November 6 and November 7. He later went missing and was found dead buried in a grave following a police investigation of the hotel owner, Adedoyin and its workers. After Adegoke was declared missing, the police were invited and seven suspects were arrested after which an investigation commenced. Later, the Intelligence Response Team, Abuja, took over the investigation and the case was transferred to the Federal Capital Territory. Upon the conclusion of the investigation, the police charged the accused persons to a high court in Abuja. Others charged alongside Adedoyin are Adedeji Adesola, 23; Magdalene Chiefuna, 24; Adeniyi Aderogba, 37; Oluwale Lawrence, 37, Oyetunde Kazeem, 38; Adebayo Kunle, 35, and some who have taken to their heels. However, the family of the victim hired human rights lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN), to take over the case. Falana subsequently wrote a letter to the Inspector-General of Police, requesting that the matter be transferred to Osun State which has jurisdiction on the matter. Granting Falana’s request, the police notified the court that it was discontinuing the matter.
