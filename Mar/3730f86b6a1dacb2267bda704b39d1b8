Ahead of its March 26 National Convention, aspirants vying for the office of national chairman of the All Progressives Congress will pay N20million to obtain forms.The party revealed this in a circular made available on Tuesday after its 25th regular meeting which was held on March 14, 2022. This is as the forms for deputy national chairman will sell for N10million while zonal chairmen and other officers will pay N5million to obtain nomination forms.Female aspirants and people with disabilities will pay 50 per cent of all the aforementioned rates.It was gathered the sale of nomination forms, which was billed to have started on Monday March 14, will close on Friday.The development comes amid the crisis in the ruling party as allies of the ousted National Chairman, Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee CECPC of the All Progressives Congress APC, Gov. Mai Mala Buni, on Tuesday, took over the Buhari House national secretariat of the party.The move, it was gathered, is suggestive of the imminent return of Governor Buni back into the country.This is even as the National Secretary of the CECPC, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe who had stayed away from the secretariat, was seen at the venue on Tuesday accompanied by the Kogi state chairman of the party, Abdullahi Bello and some aides of Gov. Buni.Many Nigerians were shocked when Governor Abubakar Bello of Niger State, last week Monday, made a dramatic entry into the party’s national secretariat in Abuja to preside over the caretaker committee meeting.He, thereafter, administered the oath of office on the controversially elected state chairmen of the party.
