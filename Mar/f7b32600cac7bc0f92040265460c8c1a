The United Kingdom has sanctioned 386 Russian lawmakers who supported Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.Foreign Secretary Liz Truss sanctioned the members of the Duma for their support for the Ukrainian breakaway regions of Luhansk and Donetsk.The UK government disclosed this in a press release on Friday.“Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has today (Friday 11 March) sanctioned 386 members of the Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, for their support for the Ukrainian breakaway regions of Luhansk and Donetsk,” the statement said.“The new sanctions will ban those listed from traveling to the UK, accessing assets held within the UK, and doing business here.” The Russian State Duma, which is the lower house of the Federal Assembly of Russia, ratified treaties in February which recognized the independence of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions – part of Ukrainian sovereign territory.It also authorized the permanent presence of the Russian military there, acting as a pretext for Russia’s invasion.In the statement, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss was quoted as saying, “We’re targeting those complicit in Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine and those who support this barbaric war. We will not let up the pressure and will continue to tighten the screw on the Russian economy through sanctions. “Together with our allies, we stand firmly beside our Ukrainian friends. We will continue to support Ukraine with humanitarian aid, defensive weapons, and diplomatic work to isolate Russia internationally. “The designations announced today build on yesterday’s crackdown on key oligarchs from Putin’s inner circle, and the introduction of new UK powers to detain Russian aircraft and ban the export of aviation items. “Since Russia’s invasion, the UK has sanctioned more than 500 of Russia’s most significant and high-value individuals, entities, and subsidiaries, bringing the total now covered by the UK’s sanctions list to over 800.“This includes travel bans and asset freezes applied to 18 of Russia’s leading oligarchs, with a combined worth in excess of £30 billion.”The latest round of sanctions brings the total number of Duma members sanctioned by the UK to 400.On 9 March, the Foreign Secretary announced new powers to detain Russian aircraft in the UK and remove aircraft belonging to designated individuals and entities from the UK register.Additional measures banned the export of aviation and space-related goods and technology, including technical assistance, and prevented UK companies from providing insurance and re-insurance services in relation to these goods and technology.
