Gbade, the elder brother to late Timothy Adegoke, on Monday, said he saw bloodstains on the wall of the room where his brother lodged at Hilton Honors Hotel, Ile-Ife when he and some operatives inspected the room.Gbade, who was the third prosecution witness while being led in evidence by the prosecution counsel, M. Omosun, also said he observed during the visit that the door to the room was damaged and repaired. But while being cross examined by K Eleja, SAN, counsel for the hotel owner, Dr Ramon Adedoyin, admitted not writing that there were bloodstains on the wall and that the door to the room was damaged in the two statements he wrote before the police, which were earlier admitted as evidence by the court.Gbade also told the court he was approached by one Edmund on phone to accept a sum of N50 million, while the wife of the deceased, he said, was offered N70million to settle the matter.He, however, said Adedoyin did not personally offer him money.He also said the receptionist on duty the day late Adegoke lodged in the hotel, Adesola Adedeji, after she was arrested told the Investigative Police Officer in charge of the case that lodger’s register of the hotel had been doctored.Bolatito, wife of late the deceased also wept uncontrollably while testifying before the court.The widow who cried for justice on her husband’s death refused to be consoled for a few minutes before she later got herself composed for her testimony in court.She earlier refused to answer a question posed to her by K. K. Eleja SAN, counsel to Adedoyin during cross-examination and this forced the court to stand down the trial and the judge advised the prosecution to caution the witness.Tears flowed from Bolatito’s eyes while testifying after being led in evidence by the prosecutor, Ochogwe before the presiding judge, Justice Oyebola Adepele Ojo.Justice Adepele, however, assured the witness of justice but maintained that she cannot get justice if she refuses to answer questions put before her.Bolatito told the court, “On 5 November 2021, my husband left home for his final exam at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife.“My husband did not joke with his family. When he was going and he arrived at the airport, he called me that he was at the Abuja airport.“He had a meeting with tax officers in Ibadan. He was carrying a leather box which he said he would not want to go with to Ife. I called a friend named Iyabo Ogeji at Akure to collect the leather box from him. He called me that my friend has collected the leather box from him and my friend also called to confirm.“When he arrived in Ife, at Hilton Hotel he called me again. At about 8pm, I called him to report one of our children to him. He told me that I should not worry that he wanted to wake up by 12 to read. He said we would talk later.”She also insisted that her husband was not sick, and while being cross-examined by one of the defence counsel, Kunle Adegoke, SAN, on why she was making frequent calls to her husband, Bolatito said calls to her husband on the day the incident happened were not unusually persistent.Adegoke had lodged in Hilton Hotels and Resorts at Ile-Ife upon his arrival from Abuja on November 5 to enable him to arrive early for his examination at the OAU Distance Learning Centre, Moro, Osun State, on November 6 and November 7.He later went missing and was found dead buried in a grave following police investigation of the hotel owner, Dr Rahman Adedoyin and its workers.After Adegoke was declared missing, the police were invited and seven suspects were arrested after which investigation commenced.Later, the Intelligence Response Team, Abuja, took over the investigation and the case was transferred to the Federal Capital Territory.Upon the conclusion of investigation, the police charged the accused persons to a high court in Abuja.Others charged alongside Adedoyin are Adedeji Adesola, 23; Magdalene Chiefuna, 24; Adeniyi Aderogba, 37; Oluwale Lawrence, 37, Oyetunde Kazeem, 38; Adebayo Kunle, 35, and some who have taken to their heels.However, the family of the victim hired human rights lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN), to take over the case.Falana subsequently wrote a letter to the Inspector-General of Police, requesting that the matter be transferred to Osun State which has jurisdiction on the matter.Granting Falana’s request, the police notified the court that it was discontinuing the matter.
