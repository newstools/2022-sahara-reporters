The Minister, in a memo, signed by the acting Director, Human Resources Management and Administration, C.A. Ibe, and dated March 21, 2022, ordered Igwe's return to the position of director in the institute.This is despite the fact that Igwe is being tried at an Ikeja High Court over the matter following orders from the Presidency.Igwe was caught in a web of dirty scams after submitting a Doctor of Philosophy certificate that was later discovered to be fake.The doctorate that he claimed he completed at the Universite D’Abomey Calavi, Benin Republic, in 2001, was non-existent.Meanwhile, in a memo dated September 7, 2021, and signed by Ibrahim Dikko Adamu, the Senior Special Assistant to the President (Administration & Operations), Buhari had ordered the Governing Board of FIIRO to immediately commence the process of the appointment of a substantive Director-General having noted that Igwe was not qualified for the position. Also, the President warned that the HMST should allow the Governing Board of FIIRO to operate freely in its selection. Buhari, according to the memo, also declined a request from the Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation that Dr. Chima Cartney Igwe should be appointed as the substantive Director-General of FIIRO, Oshodi.The President further ordered the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) to prosecute Igwe, for forging his certificate.
