Three serving governors in Nigeria are currently under watch by security agencies over an alleged plot to incite violence that may engulf parts of the country.According to Vanguard, the governors, who are in their final term in office, are reportedly from the North-East, North-Central and the South-South geopolitical zones of the country. The three governors, according to information, reportedly met in a secret location and mapped out their plan to stage a nationwide protest that would take the form of the 2020 #EndSARS protest. The goal is to make Nigerians kick against the current administration of President Muhammadu Buhari and its failures.Under the plot, which a foremost security agency is monitoring, the North-East governor is to kickstart the groundwork for the planned mass protest with a meeting with key stakeholders from the North in Kaduna with the allegation that the government had marginalised certain groups in his state and should be rejected in the 2023 polls.The Kaduna meeting, according to the security agency, discussed in detail how to mobilise aggrieved Nigerian students who had been forced to stay at home due to the ongoing strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU. Civil societies and politicians are to join the planned mass protests to register the kind of impact that the 2020 protest recorded nationwide.A top security official, who is monitoring the situation, claimed that while they were not against freedom of association and protest, they were worried the planned protests could escalate into national violence that would be difficult to control.“It is for this reason that our agency and sister security organisations have placed the three governors under constant watch and we are going to monitor their activities to ensure that they do not plunge the nation into an avoidable crisis,” the senior official of the Nigerian government said on Saturday night. “We have also deployed our men to flashpoints to ensure that the country is not pushed into the precipice by malevolent politicians who have virtually come to the end of their tenure and do not care if the country burns or not."
