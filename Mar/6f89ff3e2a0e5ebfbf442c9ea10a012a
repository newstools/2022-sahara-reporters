No fewer than six police officers have been shot dead by their colleague, Sergeant Bello in Maiduguri, Borno State.  The unfortunate incident occurred inside the police college quarters in Borno. File photo used to illustrate story. The college quarters is in the Police headquarters in Maiduguri, the state capital. According to sources, the errant officer has since been detained at the State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID). It was gathered that the police sergeant had a misunderstanding with his wife, and when relations and neighbours tried to intervene, he didn’t listen. Rather, the officer shot dead six of his colleagues, and two others, including his father-in-law. “He and his wife have been having issues for some time now; we tried to settle it amicably, but he refused. “The wife told her parents that the sergeant assaulted her; she moved her things out of his house. The wife left due to severe maltreatment by her husband. “He started shooting and threatened to kill everyone. Unfortunately, he shot people, but six mobile policemen died and two others are currently receiving treatment at Specialist Hospital. “He razed down two blocks of eight rooms in the process and also shot his father-in-law,” the source was quoted as saying.
