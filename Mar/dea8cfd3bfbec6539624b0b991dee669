Two persons have been reported dead after a clash between operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) and some hoodlums in Jalingo, Taraba State. Officials of the NDLEA were reported to have engaged the thugs in a gun duel during a raid on camps of some drug peddlers at the popular ATC market in the state capital.  The hoodlums were said to have attacked the security personnel and were making efforts to disarm them before their action turned against them. They also smashed the official Hilux van of the officers. Two of the hoodlums were reportedly killed at the spot by the NDLEA officers while many sustained injuries.
