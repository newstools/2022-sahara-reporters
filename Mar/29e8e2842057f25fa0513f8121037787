Some gunmen have kidnapped a four-year-old girl, Esther Olisa, at the Danjuma area of Oke-Aro in the Akure South local government area of Ondo State. Esther was reportedly abducted around 8pm on Saturday.  The victim was at home with her parents, when "four hefty men" entered the house and collected the father’s phones, it was learnt. They took the little girl on their way out and left in a black Toyota Camry with tinted windows and windshields, according to Leadership. The girl’s father, Mr Oga Olisa, was said to have reported the case at “B” Divisional Police station in Akure the following day. However, the Police Public Relations Officer, Fumilayo Odunlami, who confirmed the incident, said the young girl was kidnapped by four unknown men from her parent’s residence in the late hours of Saturday. “So far, a male suspect has been arrested by our men of ‘B’ Division police station where the father of the girl reported the case and he has been handed over to the Anti-Kidnapping Department of the State Police Command in Akure. “All hands are on deck to ensure the safety of the young girl as high profile investigation is ongoing,” the police spokesperson said.
