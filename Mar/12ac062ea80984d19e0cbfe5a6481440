No fewer than 7000 Boko Haram and Islamic State’s West Africa Province (ISWAP) terrorists have turned themselves in since last week, the Nigerian Army has said. This was made known by the Theatre Commander, Operation Hadin Kai (OPHK), Major General Christopher Musa while speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Maiduguri on Wednesday.  According to the General, sustained operations against the ISWAP and Boko Haram have led to significant successes. “Thousands of insurgents comprising of combatants, non-combatants, foot soldiers alongside their families, continued to lay down their arms in different parts of Borno,” he noted. He added that the repentant terrorists and their families would be profiled by the army and other agencies before they undergo rehabilitation processes. Musa assured that the military and other security agencies would continue to devise and implement strategies to end terrorism. About 30,000 insurgents and their families have surrendered in the last nine months.
