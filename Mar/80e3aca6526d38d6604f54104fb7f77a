The West African Examinations Council (WAEC) has released the results of the recently conducted West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) for private candidates which was held between January and February 2022.The announcement was contained in a statement by the Head of National Office, WAEC Nigeria, Patrick Areghan, and issued by its acting head of the public affairs unit, Moyosola Adeyegbe. According to the statement, a total of 7,166 candidates sat the examination nationwide with only 1,886 of them (representing 26.32%) obtaining credit pass and above in a minimum of five subjects including English language and mathematics.It further noted that the registration figure for this year’s first series examination diet for private candidates declined by 4.85 per cent.Out of the 7,166 candidates that sat the examination, 2,835 candidates representing 39.56 per cent obtained credit and above in a minimum of five subjects with or without English Language and or Mathematics.The body further noted that out of the total number, who sat the examination, only 6,949 (representing 96.97% ) have their results fully processed and released while 217 candidates (representing 3.03%) have a few of their subjects still being processed due to some errors on the part of the candidates and that efforts are ongoing to rectify the errors and release those results.However, WAEC explained that despite the decline in the performance of candidates in the exam this year over the previous two years, the results should not be compared with that of the school-based exam where up to 80 per cent of the total candidates obtained similar results.According to the statement, candidates in the school-based WASSCE are compelled to sit for between eight and nine subjects while private candidates in the case of the first and second series of the exam are free to sit for a number of subjects even one depending on their deficiency.“That is why it is will not be true or fair to say that the performance in this examination has dwindled,” a part of the statement noted.
