Governor Abubakar Sani Bello of Niger State, on Monday, arrived at the National Headquarters of the All Progressives Congress, Abuja to take over as Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the party. The development comes amid a rumoured crisis plaguing the leadership of the APC.  President Muhammadu Buhari had allegedly approved the removal of the Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, as the Chairman of the CECPC and in his stead, appointed his Niger State counterpart, Abubakar Sani Bello. Meanwhile, on Monday, Bello arrived at the APC headquarters and is currently in a meeting with the leadership of the party. A tweet from TVC reads, “Niger State Governor @abusbello has arrived the National Headquarters of the APC to take over as Chairman of the CECPC from Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni.” “Secretary, Caretaker Committee, John AkpanUdoedehe has also arrived at the national secretariat. “The leadership of the party is currently in a closed-door meeting with Niger state Governor.” According to reports, some APC governors were alleged to have complained bitterly to the president that Buni was not inclined to hold the convention as rescheduled, because there were no preparations on the ground to indicate so.
