Additionally, troops also destroyed various camps of the terrorists.” Since the death of JAS leader, Abubakar Shekau, ISWAP has been consolidating its grip in locations around Lake Chad. In 2021, it appointed Wali Sani Shuwaram, a 45-year-old as the new Leader (Wali) of ISWAP in Lake Chad. The sect’s membership has swollen with the defection of hundreds of Boko Haram fighters under Shekau. The terror group has caused the death of over 300,000 persons and displaced millions of individuals mainly in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe states.
