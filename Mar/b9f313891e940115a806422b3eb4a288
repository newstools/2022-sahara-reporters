The National Assembly members have been urged to reconsider the bills seeking special parliamentary seats for women in the national and state assemblies.The Nigerian First Lady, Aisha Buhari, made the call on Thursday in a statement while reacting to the decision of the federal lawmakers who also turned down the proposal of 35 per cent affirmative action for women in political parties’ administration in the proposed amendments to the 1999 Constitution.





Aisha in the statement titled “RE: National Assembly and the quest for Affirmative Action” asked the house to revise and reconsider reversing their conclusions so that no group, especially mothers, wives, daughters, and partners who women are, would suffer discrimination, or be denied of opportunities to contribute to the process of nation-building.She said, “The recent decision by the National Assembly to ignore the long-standing clamour for Affirmative Action for Nigerian women was contrary to the very high expectations of forward-looking Nigerian men and women.“The anger of Nigerians in the circumstance is therefore understandable, more so that not a single concession was made to women, contrary to the global practice of give-and-take for which people’s parliaments are noted for.“Notwithstanding this temporary setback, however, I, on behalf of the wife of the Vice President, Dolapo Osinbajo, join the multitude of Nigerian men and women to thank relevant UN agencies, local and international Non-governmental organisations, faith-based groups, and all other stakeholders and individuals for their charitable support for fair representation by women in legislative houses, public governance, and management of political parties.“I am of the opinion that our esteemed National Assembly can still review its decision and pray that our compatriots will deeply reflect on this political, but emotive matter.“I call on both the Senate and the House of Representatives as Husbands, Fathers, Brothers and Grandfathers to revise and reconsider reversing their conclusions so that no group, especially mothers, wives, daughters, and partners who women are, would suffer discrimination, or be denied of opportunities to contribute to the process of nation-building. Yours in the service of our great nation,” the statement added.
