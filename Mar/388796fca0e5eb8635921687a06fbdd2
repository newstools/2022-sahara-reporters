The Kenyan government has denied its involvement in the arrest and extradition of Nnamdi Kanu, the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).In a letter to the office of President Uhuru Kenyatta, dated September 29, 2021, it noted that Kanu had not been processed to leave the country. “According to our records as per the PISCES system, Nwannekaenyi Kenny Okwu-Kanu is still in Kenya because he has not exited the country,” the letter reads.Last June, the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, had announced that Kanu had been arrested.Malami, in a joint press briefing with the State Security Service (SSS) in Abuja, announced that international collaborative efforts with security agencies led to Kanu’s arrest and repatriation to Nigeria.This raised speculations as to the involvement of the United Kingdom, where Mr Kanu was residing, or Kenya.In July 2021, the Kenyan high commissioner to Nigeria, Wilfred Machage, had denied that Kanu was arrested in Kenya. Machage had said the allegation was made to incite Nigerians in the South-East against the Kenyan people.His denial was made despite evidence compiled by Kanu’s family and attorneys to prove Kenya’s involvement in abducting Kanu.Machage died in January 2022 ahead of his testimony in the Biafra separatist leader’s abduction case in Nairobi.The UK also denied its involvement in Kanu’s arrest. Its spokesperson, Dean Hurlock, said that Kanu was not caught in the UK though they could confirm his arrest.Kanu was arraigned at the Federal High Court, Abuja, last June and his trial has faced constant delays.The IPOB leader faces a seven-count charge bordering on terrorism, treasonable felony, and insulting President Muhammadu Buhari.In 2019, a Federal High Court judge had revoked Mr Kanu’s bail that was granted him on health grounds and issued a bench warrant for his arrest on the same date.
