President Vladimir Putin-led Russian government has said fighters from Syria and the Middle East would be allowed to fight for Russia in Ukraine.Putin’s Press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, had said “most of those who want and has asked to fight are citizens of Middle East countries and Syrians.”Russia was a pivotal partner to Syrian President, Bashar al-Assad, when war broke out in 2015, rallying to his side in the conflict and turning the tide of the fighting in the regime’s favour.Peskov said the decision to send volunteer fighters to Ukraine was acceptable, claiming that the US was backing measures to send mercenaries to fight alongside Kyiv’s army in Ukraine.Russia in February launched military action against Ukraine, spurring an exodus of refugees in Europe and allegations of war crimes.“If the West is so enthusiastic about the arrival of mercenaries, then we also have volunteers who want to participate,” Peskov told journalists.Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu also mentioned that more than 16,000 primarily Middle Eastern volunteers had appealed to join the military action.
