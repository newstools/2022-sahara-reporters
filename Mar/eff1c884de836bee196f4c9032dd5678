An Islamic group, the Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC), has demanded a probe of the Jos University Teaching Hospital (JUTH), Plateau State, over an allegation that the facility discriminated against Hausa-Fulani Muslims.There have been media reports that some of the Muslim residents were forced by record officers at JUTH to change their states of origin and local government areas before they could register to see a doctor. MURIC in a statement issued on Sunday, by its director, Prof Ishaq Akintola, called for an investigation.The statement partly reads, “It is highly appalling. We cannot imagine such inhuman practice happening to Nigerian citizens in a Nigerian state. Such audacity is criminal. There must be consequences for such temerity for the culprits, their sponsors and those who are encouraging them.“The probe should unearth the identities of all the victims from the time the evil practice started with a view to reversing the wicked acts and restoring the states of origin and local governments of the victims.“We are shocked that such a discriminatory practice is being allowed in a federally funded hospital where people’s state of origin should not matter at all, particularly for health care delivery. It points to the likelihood of more egregious and horrifying things happening in hospitals belonging to the Plateau state government. “There is no doubt that the state government is complicit and should be held responsible. It is impossible that this highly reprehensible practice is happening without the knowledge and tacit approval of the state government. It is a big shame that this kind of illegality is being promoted by a state governor who swore to uphold the constitution and to provide welfare services to the people of the state. Conscienceless power is subjugating powerless conscience.”
