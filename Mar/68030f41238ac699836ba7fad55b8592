The acting Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Abubakar Sani Bello and members of the party's National Executive Committee will meet on Thursday. According to a memo issued by Bello, who is also the governor of Niger State, the virtual meeting slated for 11 am is to discuss issues bordering on the National Convention, governance and any other relevant business of the party.   The memo reads, “Pursuant to Article 258 (i and ii) of the Party Constitution, and by the power vested on the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) via the NEC resolution of 8th December 2020, the CECPC of the Party at its 23rd meeting of 8 March, 2022, hereby calls for the meeting of the National Executive Committee (NEC) of our great Party, the All Progressives Congress (APC) to consider matters pertaining to the National Convention, governance of the party and any other relevant business of the party. “The meeting is scheduled to hold as follows; Date: Thursday, 17th March 2022. Time: 11:00 am Prompt. Venue: Virtual meeting. “All members of the NEC are by this invitation to take notice of the meeting in accordance with Article 12.3." Meanwhile, Sani-Bello had earlier inaugurated chairmen and secretaries of sub-committees for the March 26th National Convention of the party. The new panels have however been reduced to a manageable size for effective delivery, according to Sani-Bello. Sani-Bello took over on Monday as the acting chairman of the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, CECPC amid tight security. This followed the removal of Mai Mala Buni by President Muhammadu Buhari. The then National Secretary of CECPC, James Akpanudoedehe, had debunked the report, describing it as fake news.
