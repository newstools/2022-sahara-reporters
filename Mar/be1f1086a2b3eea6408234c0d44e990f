At least two and a half million people have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded on February 24, the United Nations said on Friday. The UN said another two million have been internally displaced by the war.  The UN refugee agency's chief Filippo Grandi blamed the mass displacement on what he called a "senseless war" that began on February 24. "The number of refugees from Ukraine - tragically - has reached today 2.5 million," UNHCR chief Grandi tweeted. "We also estimate that about two million people are displaced inside Ukraine. Millions forced to leave their homes by this senseless war." According to Paul Dillon, spokesman for the UN's international organisation for migration, the two and a half million people who had fled Ukraine included 116,000 nationals from other countries. Meanwhile, more than half of those who have fled the troubled country was said to have gone to Poland. Before the Russian attack, Ukraine had a population of over 37 million.
