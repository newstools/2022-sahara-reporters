 An officer of the Oyo State security outfit, Operation Burst, drafted to maintain peace at Iluju in the Oriire Local Government Area of Oyo State has been reportedly killed. According to reports, the officer and a civilian died when the Operation Burst team was invited to restore order at a football field where a match was to be played on Sunday.  A resident had parked his motorcycle on the football field where the match between Iluju United and another team was to be played and the person refused to remove his motorcycle. The development reportedly led to a misunderstanding, compelling one of the factions to invite men of Operation Burst to settle the crisis. However, the officers could not settle the matter and one of the officers shot a villager, a development which prompted the other villagers to go on a reprisal. The crisis that followed resulted in the death of an officer and the destruction of a van belonging to Operation Burst. The incident was confirmed by the Director-General of Operation Burst, Col Oladipo Ajibola to journalists in Ibadan on Monday. He said a rifle was recovered from the youths while the corpse of the soldier had been deposited in a morgue, noting that normalcy had been restored in the village.
