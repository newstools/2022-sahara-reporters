The Nigerian government has introduced a compulsory form for citizens still stranded in troubled Ukraine to fill. This was disclosed by Abike Dabiri-Erewa, Chairperson of Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM), on her verified Twitter handle on Wednesday.  “Update #Ukraine. Must fill. Questionnaire for stranded citizens in Ukraine. @nidcom_gov,” she wrote. The questionnaire has slots for name, country of origin, border crossing point, destination point, planned route (if any), number of people in your group, Special needs (if any), contact information (phone number, messengers, email) and comments. Nigeria had announced that some of its stranded citizens following the Russian invasion would arrive in the country on Thursday via Max Air. Nigeria’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, said about 5,600 Nigerian students are in Ukraine and maybe a total of 8,000 Nigerian citizens in the country. Questionnaire (google.com)
