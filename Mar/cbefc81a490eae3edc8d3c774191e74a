The Green Nigeria Movement (GNM) has urged Nigerians not to support any presidential candidate who is above 70 years old. The group disclosed this on Tuesday at a consultation breakfast meeting with Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) and journalists held in Abuja. File photo used to illustrate story. The Convener of the GNM and Chairman of the Nigerian Young Professionals Forum (NYPF), Moses Siloko Siasia, said the group was posed to mobilise up to 12million votes for a credible Presidential Candidate at the forthcoming 2023 general elections. He, however, said the movement had resolved not to support presidential candidates who were more than 70 years old. Siasia harped that the GNM's choice of candidate would be tied to capacity, ideas and professionalism, adding that a SWOT analysis would be conducted to come up with candidates that fit its objectives. “At GNM we are not lost to the realities that there is no cause that can advance without partnership and collaboration. That is why we are gathered here as movers and shakers to harness our expertise towards promoting active participation of young people in politics, as well as to support a technocrat and seasoned professional in the forthcoming elections,” he said. President of SWA Sports, Aisha Shuaibu, charged the group to gather "like minded individuals, build networks, collect data, and be honest in its activities.” The GNM is an initiative of the NYPF which aims to among many other goals, identify a credible presidential candidate and throw its weight behind the candidate by mobilizing massive votes across the country. The platform also seeks to enlighten voters. The Presidential and National Assembly elections have been slated for February 25, 2023, while Governorship and State Assembly elections will now be held on March 11, 2023, according to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) announced.
