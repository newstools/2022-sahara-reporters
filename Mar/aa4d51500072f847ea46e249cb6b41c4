The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has taken a swipe at the Governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello, over his 2023 presidential ambition.The party, in a statement signed by its Director, Media and Communications, Dayo Onibiyo, warned the governor not to use the state's “lean” resources for his personal ambition or else he would pay for it. The statement was in reaction to a comment credited to Bello that he would declare his ambition to vie for the APC presidential ticket on the 2nd of April 2022.The PDP warned that the state funds should not be used to hire a crowd to the venue to make it seem like Bello was widely accepted.The statement reads “We are aware that, on Saturday 2nd of April, 2022 at the Eagle Square, Mr. Yahaya is proposing to declare his ambition to vie for APC presidential ticket and to that effect.“We know the state’s lean resources will suffer for it, as plans are in top gear to mobilise all manners of people from everywhere they can get them paid, to try and make it look like they have come to willingly support Yahaya with their own funds.“This plan to bring all sorts of human beings to the venue is aimed at telling people that he (Yahaya) is on ground, and this is heavily on state purse. While we wish him well in his travels, we are quick to remind him that the state funds are not meant for such personal pursuit and this warning will serve as evidence against him, thereafter.”The party added, “This is grossly unfortunate and regrettable even as President Buhari and his Presidential managers watch Governor Bello plunder the state resources while the people suffer in Kogi State.“This is the same way members of the State House of Assembly under the current Speaker started going round states claiming to be preaching the gospel of Yahaya Bello to other houses of Assembly in the country where APC hold sway for support.“Once again, we call on all Kogi sons and daughters to intensify their vigilance, prayers and mobilisation in readiness to boot the APC out, come next elections in the state.”
