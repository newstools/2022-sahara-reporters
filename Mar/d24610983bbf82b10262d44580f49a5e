About 25 persons were reportedly killed and several others kidnapped by terrorists, locally known as bandits, in the Giwa Local Government Area located in the central senatorial zone of Kaduna State. This is the fourth attack in a row by bandits within a week in villages across the LGA.  About 50 people were killed in the council area by bandits in a similar attack three days ago. SaharaReporters gathered that two villages were attacked by the terrorists on Tuesday. The bandits were said to have invaded the communities and opened fire on residents. The affected villages are Anguwar Maiwa and Anguwar Kanwa while several houses and motorcycles were burnt by the attackers who also rustled cows belonging to the locals. A resident said over 25 dead bodies had been discovered and subsequently buried.
