About 25 soldiers from 13 Brigade of Nigerian Army, Calabar, Cross River State, are in critical condition after being involved in a road crash on Friday night in the state, a report by Daily Trust said. Eyewitnesses said a truck occupied by the soldiers was speeding when the accident occurred. File Photo Etim Akpan, an eyewitness, said five female officers were seriously wounded. He said, “Many of them had their heads smashed. Several others sustained varying degrees of injury “It was raining and we saw that the army truck was on top speed. It could not slow down at the speed breaker point. “So it hit the speed breaker, jumped and crashed into a Sienna vehicle which was meant for sale. The truck fell into a big gutter. “We had to help rescue the occupants. They have been taken to a navy hospital in Calabar.” It was learnt that the soldiers were heading for Ogoja. One Dr Oyi of the accident and emergency at the navy hospital confirmed the incident but added that two patients had been moved to the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital. One army Captain, H. I. Audu, at the hospital said he could not speak on the condition of the victims, noting that he had to attend to the emergency situation first. Mr John Eluu, owner of the Sienna bus crushed by the truck, said it was meant for sale and appealed to the military authorities to assist him in replacing the bus.
