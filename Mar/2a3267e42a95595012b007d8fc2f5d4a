Roman Abramovich is on the run from sanctions and may have fled to Moscow after the European Union (EU) decided to punish him over the Russia-Ukraine crisis. According to a report by Daily Mail, the 55-year-old Russian billionaire's flight is also evident as his two superyachts worth £1billion race for safe Turkish waters. The report noted that Abramovich who looked grey and thin flew to Tel Aviv in his private jet on Monday hours after Israel said it will not be a safe place for sanctioned oligarchs. Abramovich was pictured in the VIP lounge of Ben Gurion Airport, shortly before the aircraft took off for Turkey. Last night the same plane flew into Russia, landing in Moscow at around 3 am UK time. The flights put him beyond the reach of Israel and the European Union, which yesterday agreed to sanction Abramovich. Last night a BBC Panorama documentary accused him of being 'Putin's money man' and said it had uncovered new evidence about alleged corrupt deals that made his gigantic fortune. According to one expert's claims, Abramovich had 'stolen billions' from the Russian taxpayers. However, his lawyers insist there is no basis for alleging he amassed wealth through criminality. The European Union is sanctioning Abramovich because of the claim that his cash is oiling the machines of Russia's war. Politico, who says they have seen a draft of the document, claims it says Abramovich enjoys 'privileged access' to Vladimir Putin and these 'very good relations' line his own pockets in industries that offered 'a substantial source of revenue' to the Kremlin, helping Moscow fund its invasion of Ukraine. Last week, the United Kingdom sanctioned him over suspicions that Evraz, the steel giant he controls, is alleged to have supplied steel to produce Putin's army of tanks.
