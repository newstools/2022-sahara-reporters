Terrorists have detonated bombs on the rail track of the Abuja-Kaduna train and successfully immobilised it. Credible sources confirmed the attack to Daily Nigerian on Monday night, saying the attack occurred at a point between Katari and Rijana areas.  Sources also told SaharaReporters that the attack was still ongoing as of 9.42 pm press time, while calling for security agencies to deploy to the scene. One of the passengers who confirmed the incident in a telephone call said the attackers had surrounded the train and were shooting sporadically. “All the passengers are currently lying on the floor of the train. The bandits are shooting sporadically. We are in serious danger,” said one of the panic-stricken passengers. There are at least 970 passengers onboard the train, according to official sources familiar with the train service.
