The Nigeria Police Force personnel, on Tuesday, blocked all entrances to the Cross River State House of Assembly. The officers, who also occupied the Assembly's premises, included those from the anti-kidnapping and cultism squad and the regular policemen, armed to the teeth.  They reportedly turned back staff members of the Assembly whom they cautioned not to loiter around. According to a report by Daily Post, the police officers took their positions as early as 6am on Tuesday, according to eyewitnesses. The security build-up may not be unconnected to the judgment delivered by a Federal High Court in Abuja, presided over by Justice Taiwo Taiwo, which sacked 20 lawmakers of the Cross River State House of Assembly who defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC). The lawmakers had dumped the PDP alongside Governor Ben Ayade, who said he joined the ruling party to support President Muhammadu Buhari to build a greater nation. Some of the police officers were also sighted close to Ayade’s office, which was a few metres away. Motorists and passers-by are having a difficult time navigating through the crowd of security men, their vans and other onlookers. The ruling APC had said they had applied to the Court for a stay of execution of the judgment, while they had proceeded to the Appeal Court.
