Wives of some murdered Nigerian soldiers on Thursday, March 10, staged a protest against their husbands’ killing by gunmen suspected to be bandits in Kebbi State. The protesting women who wore black barricaded the official quarters of the commanding officer of the Light Tank Battalion of the Nigerian Army in Zuru, shouting in Hausa, “Whatever will happen, let it happen, we are also ready to die.” File Photo “The killing is too much and is unacceptable, we wouldn't agree to such killing, they have turned us to widows,” one of the women was heard saying. SaharaReporters had reported how 18 soldiers lost their lives in a gun duel with bandits in the Zuru emirate of Kebbi State. The killing of the soldiers happened a day after over 60 vigilantes known as Yan-Sa-Kai, were massacred in Zuru. “Operation Hadarin Daji Special SITREP.
