Russia has lost another of its generals in the war in Ukraine, Kyiv military sources said, as Ukraine inflicts punishing losses on Moscow's war machine, Daily Mail reports.  Lieutenant General Yakov Rezantsev, 48, commander of the army's 49th combined arms division, became the fifth general to be killed after being taken out in a strike by the Ukrainian armed forces.  The general's death means the Russian army has now lost a staggering 15 military commanders in a month, as Vladimir Putin's invading forces suffer heavy losses at the hands of dogged Ukrainian defenders.  Rezantsev, who bragged on just the fourth day of the war that it would be over in a matter of hours, was apparently killed after the Ukrainian army destroyed the commanding post of the 49th Russian Army in Southern Ukraine.  It is not clear the exact location of the strike.  A soldier claimed Rezantsev told them on the fourth day of their deployment, "It's no secret to anyone that there are only a few hours until this special operation is over.  "And now those hours are still going."  Despite mobilising a force of between 150,000 and 200,000 Russian troops, Moscow has failed to anticipate anything other than weak resistance by the Ukrainian forces – likely owing to Russian intelligence failures.  A senior NATO military officer said the alliance estimates that Russia has suffered between 30,000 and 40,000 battlefield casualties in Ukraine through the first month of the war, including between 7,000 and 15,000 killed.
