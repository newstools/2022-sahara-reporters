Samuel Inyang, the father to one of the senior students of Dowen College, accused of beating the 12-year-old late Sylvester Oromoni Jnr. said his son has been suffering from paroxysm ever since he returned from the police station.Paroxysm, according to the Britannica dictionary, is a sudden strong feeling or expression of emotion that cannot be controlled. According to Tribune, Inyang, while under cross-examination by Akin George, Counsel to Lagos State Government, said his son had been in shock and crying every night after writing a statement at the police station.George referred the witness to paragraph 17 of his statement to ascertain the credibility of his son’s medical condition.After discussing with the family lawyer, the witness replied that he came with the term, paroxysm.The Counsel further asked the witness if his son had no reason whatsoever to appear before the hearing which he confirmed.Earlier, the Coroner, Mikhail Kadiri, objected to the witness as a testifier before the court, adding that he had no credible evidence because he was not the student.The counsel to the witness, Olumide Akinnimi, prayed the court to allow the witness to testify that the son was a day student and not a boarder.The court proceeding was further adjourned to March 14, 2022.
