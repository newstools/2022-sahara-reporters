The Anambra State Governor, Charles Soludo, on Tuesday reacted to the fracas between the immediate past first lady of the Anambra state, Ebele Obiano, and Bianca Ojukwu, wife of Biafran warlord, Odumegwu Ojukwu. Ebelechukwu Obiano and Ojukwu Bianca had recently fought each other at the inauguration of Soludo.  During the event, Ebelechukwu walked to where Bianca was seated, and immediately, both women engaged each other in a fisticuff. The unfortunate spectacle drew the attention of security agents and some personalities who pulled Mrs Obiano off the hold of Bianca who was visibly shocked at the action. However, Governor Soludo while speaking on Arise TV asserted that a movie or even a song would emerge from the event. He said he had enjoyed comedy that had emerged from it, noting that there was no distraction whatsoever. He said, “The comedy that has emerged from it all that I have enjoyed. There is no distraction whatsoever. I think it was meant to be. Sometime to come, there will even be some movies or comedies and even a song out of that. “As you saw, I didn’t even notice much of what happened. I think it happened while I was going to sign the oath of allegiance. It was just like a one second thing. I turned again and continued signing my thing and I have not had one minute discussing it other than the comic relief you see posted. We are intensely focused on what we must deliver to our people.”
