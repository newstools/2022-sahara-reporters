A pro-Biafra group, the Biafra Nations League (BNL) says it has taken hold of the Bakassi Peninsula, a border community between Cameroon and South-East Nigeria.This is even as the group claimed responsibility for the scarcity of movement of vessels into the Bakassi Peninsula from Cameroon to Nigeria.A statement from the BnL National Leader, Princewill C Richards, confirmed that the BnL militants had made it impossible for vessels to pass through the Peninsula to Nigeria.Richards further “commended the men for a job well done”, threatening to intercept any vessel found disobeying the orders.The development came days after armed militias took over the Peninsula in search of vessels in the area.The BnL had in the past banned vessels from entering the Peninsula or passing through the Peninsula to Nigeria.The group has once again reiterated that the sovereign state of Biafra is the only solution to peace.The group has been threatening oil companies still operating in the Peninsula.In October 2021, the group ordered the shutdown of borders between Nigeria and Southern Cameroon, in solidarity with the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, who was to appear in court.The group had in a statement by its National Leader, Princewill Richards, said the closure would be between October 19 and 22, along with its operating areas, mainly at Cameroon borders of Cross River, Akwa Ibom and Bakassi Peninsula.Some days ago, the BnL threatened to retaliate against the Nigerian government for the “military raids in their region, especially in the South East, and Bakassi Peninsula”.It described Bakassi Peninsula as its operational headquarters, saying there would be consequences for the military operations in the areas.
