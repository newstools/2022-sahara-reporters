Former Kaduna State Senator, Shehu Sani has taken a swipe at the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration.  Shehu, in a tweet on Wednesday, noted that the Buhari-led government and its officials were part of those who condemned the previous administration over the latter's failure to tackle the menace of insecurity.  However, with the increase in security challenges under the Buhari administration, he said the government does not want to be criticised or challenged over its failure to protect the citizens.   He wrote, “They criticised and cursed the past administration for failing to tackle insecurity; now they don’t want to be criticised and cursed for same failure. “If you are traveling to and from Kaduna by road or rail, until you pass the villages of Rijana or Katari before you know that you have made your journey; anything short of that your life is on a scale of probability. “We need our own North Western Security Network NWSN to tackle bandits.”  https://twitter.com/ShehuSani/status/1509132045104074755?s=20&t=OVMt13dYeP7J_QJ-FZ2o-w  Sani's comment comes on the trail of a series of attacks in Kaduna State, notably an attack on the Kaduna-Abuja train on Monday.  SaharaReporters had reported how terrorists bombed the Abuja-Kaduna train en route to its Rigasa destination with hundreds of passengers on board.  During the attack, many passengers were feared kidnapped, others were shot dead. Some of the passengers also sustained various degrees of injury.  On Tuesday, bandits launched an attack on the Abuja-Kaduna, Yankara-Tsafe roads, SaharaReporters had reported.  According to sources, the bandits who were on the rampage in the areas left several commuters stranded.  SaharaReporters had on Wednesday reported how bandits killed about 25 persons and abducted several others in the Giwa Local Government Area located in the central senatorial zone of Kaduna State.  About 50 people were killed in the council area by bandits in a similar attack three days ago.
