Many residents fled from communities in the Munya Local Government Area of Niger State after an attack by terrorists at the weekend. At least six communities were reportedly affected by the attack that started on Saturday evening and continued up till Sunday evening, Daily Trust reports.  The attack came a week after Governor Sani Bello assured Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) that they were safe to return to their communities. A resident, Shehu Abubakar, said the bandits stormed Sarkin Pawa-Minna Road where many adjoining communities were attacked. “As I speak with you now, (around 8 pm on Sunday) they are still on Sarkin Pawa-Minna Road, operating. People had started returning home and the bandits decided to strike again. “Some of our people in Minna who wanted to return today were trapped; we communicated with them and told them not to come back again,” he said. Another resident, Mr. Makama Shekwo’aga, said, “The IDPs were told to go back to their villages recently, that security had been provided. “Yesterday evening, bandits in large numbers invaded Kuchi/Chibani axis in Munya Local Government Area of Niger State, displacing people and looting shops. Fuka, Dandaudu, Mararaba, Kuchi, Chibani, Injita axes are practically all empty as people have continued to flee to Gwada in Shiroro Local Government Area.” Meanwhile, the State Commissioner for Local Government, Chieftaincy Affairs and Internal Security, Emmanuel Umar, said he was “already preparing a statement on the incident”.
