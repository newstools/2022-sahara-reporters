The Nigeria Railway Corporation, NRC, has suspended its Abuja-Kaduna train service after terrorists blew off its train on Monday night, killing and injuring some passengers in the process. The NRC made the announcement in a terse statement on its Twitter page.  In the ill-fated train, many are feared kidnapped and two confirmed dead, while others sustained injuries during the attack. The NRC wrote on Tuesday, “Dear passengers, due to unforeseen circumstances, train operations along the Abuja-Kaduna route has been temporarily suspended. “Further communication would be given in due course.” SaharaReporters earlier reported that a former Deputy Governor of Zamfara State, Malam Ibrahim Wakkala, was among the Abuja-Kaduna train passengers who was shot by terrorists on Monday evening.

SaharaReporters on Monday night also reported that Muhammad Amin Mahmood, an aspirant in the just-concluded National Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the Northwest Zonal Youth Leadership, was shot during the attack on Monday. SaharaReporters learnt the politician was on board the train and was one of those shot during the train ride which was heading to Kaduna from Abuja. However, as of the time of filing this report, it was not clear how critical his injuries were or if he would survive.

There are at least 970 passengers on board the train, according to official sources familiar with the train service.
