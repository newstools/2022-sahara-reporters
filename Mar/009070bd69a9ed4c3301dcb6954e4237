The attack has thrown the agrarian community into mourning following the loss of their kinsmen, as residents have reportedly deserted the community for fear of another attack. According to a report by Vanguard, trouble started when some youth chased some herders out of their farms for allegedly allowing their cows to destroy hectares of cassava farms. In the ensuing struggle between the youths and the herders, some cows were said to have been killed, causing the herdsmen to launch a reprisal. A community leader in Mgbuji, Eric Ebeh who confirmed the attack said the casualty figure was yet to be ascertained as the affected communities were still combing the bushes for more victims. “Up till now, palpable fear has not allowed anyone to enter the farm settlements to search for victims or ascertain the level of destruction. I am not in the village presently but I have made enquires and confirmed that there was an attack on my community. Some of the persons I called presented conflicting figures. While some said that six persons were allegedly killed, others put the casualty figure at seven or eight. We, are yet to know the actual number of victims of that attack,” he said.
