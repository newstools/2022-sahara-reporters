It was gathered that three other men were also abducted from another bus on their way from Ekiti State.However, the abductors insisted on a ransom of N20 million to release the six victims.Although efforts to speak with the Police Public Relations Officer, Ajayi Okasanmi, was not successful as calls and messages were neither answered nor replied to, the Transition Implementation Committee (TIC) Chairman of Ekiti Local Government, Kayode Bayode, and the lawmaker representing the council at the State House of Assembly, Gabriel Afolarin, confirmed the incident in separate interviews with Daily Trust on Sunday.According to the TIC chairman, who gave the name of the other two ward women leaders as Mrs Reachel Alasi (Obbo Ayegunle ward) and Mrs Yemisi Oloke Oni (Eruku ward), the deceased was killed during an exchange of gunfire with the abductors.“The (N20m) ransom had been prepared but our vigilantes insisted that they wanted to go and rescue the victims. Unfortunately, we lost Mrs Olomi Sunday during the gun battle. The men also sustained injuries and one of them is in a serious condition from the gunshots suffered in the process. I’m at the hospital now in the council where they were taken for treatment,” he said.Also speaking, Ganiyu Gabriel Afolarin told our reporter, “Yes, we lost the woman leader of Eruku ward (Mrs Olomi Sunday) during an exchange of gunfire between the abductors and our local vigilantes.
