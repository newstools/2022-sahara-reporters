The national body of the National Union of Road Transport Workers in Abuja has been given a seven-day ultimatum to withdraw the suspension of its Lagos State Chairman, Musiliu Akinsanya, aka MC Oluomo.  The national body of the union last Thursday suspended MC Oluomo following weeks of protracted conflict and leadership tussle.  However, the Lagos State Council Group of Elders of the National Union of Road Transport Workers issued the ultimatum in a letter that was co-signed by Samuel Jonah, Alao Adewuyi, Alamu Otegbeye, Bola Lemboye and Stephen Falusi, to the national body of the union dated March 14, 2022, made available on Tuesday.  In the letter titled, ‘Resolutions of Lagos State Council of NURTW Elders’ Forum on the current crisis in the Union’, the elders also asked the national body of the union to withdraw a letter appointing another chairman for the Lagos State Chapter of the Tricycle Owners and Operators Association of Nigeria.  The letter read, “Following the recent crisis rocking the Union in the state, the Elders of the Union met and resolved as follows:  “In order to close the tension, the National Headquarters should withdraw the controversial letter of Appointment of another Chairman for (Keke Maruwa) Tricycles as there cannot be two State Chairman in one State Council. There are no such provisions in the Union Constitution.  “Revoke the suspension letter of the State Chairman which we view as unwarranted at this period in the history of our Union.  “Finally, we expect the withdrawal of these two letters within seven days (7) to enable us to conclude the settlement of the crisis once and for all.”
