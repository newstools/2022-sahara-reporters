According to Aliyu, the government is working to improve the situation by optimising gas supply. He warned electricity distribution companies against selling meters, saying customers should get them free of charge. He noted that the rollout of one million meters for the first phase of the government's initiative to reduce the metering gap would be followed up with the provision of four million more. “We are engaging with the state governors through the Nigerian Governors Forum to drive a holistic solution to these lingering issues. "Some examples of critical projects held up by right of way are the Benin to Oshogbo which I’ve mentioned 330 KV line which is 250 kilometres, Ikot Ekepene to Ikot Abasi, also 330 KV line, 68 kilometres and the Kano-Katsina 330 KV line, 180 kilometres,” he said.
