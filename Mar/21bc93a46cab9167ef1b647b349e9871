The Lagos State Police Command has dismissed reports that the private parts of 22-year-old Miss Oluwabamise Ayanwole are missing.The state police commissioner, Abiodun Alabi told journalists on Tuesday that an autopsy will be carried out on the deceased to ascertain if she was raped. “No part of her body was mutilated and we cannot ascertain if she was raped. An autopsy will reveal that after post mortem examination,” he said at a news briefing.The young woman went missing on February 26, 2022, after she boarded a BRT with number 240257 heading to Oshodi at about 7:30 pm to see her sister-in-law, who was said to be in labour. The fashion designer was said to have become suspicious when the driver of the bus told her to sit at the back despite being the only one in the vehicle. She was later declared missing by her relations. The bus was driven by Nice Andrew Omininikoron, who has now been arrested by the police. On Monday, Bamise was found dead. According to Alabi, the bus driver was arrested along with the person presumed to have harboured him.“He ran to that person’s house. The person was not part of the dastardly act. We have interrogated him and he said the man was not on that bus that day,” he said.SaharaReporters had reported that James Joel, a family member of the woman, said the police treated the young woman’s case with levity.Joel, who spoke during a press briefing on Tuesday, said Bamise's sister had gone to the police station on Sunday, February 27 to file a missing person's case but was brushed aside by police officers on duty.Shortly after her body was found on Monday, the police in Lagos revealed that the driver of the BRT vehicle, Omininikoron, who went into hiding immediately after the incident, had been arrested.The spokesperson for the police in Lagos, Adekunle Ajisebutu, confirmed the arrest, adding that more details into the matter would be provided later.
