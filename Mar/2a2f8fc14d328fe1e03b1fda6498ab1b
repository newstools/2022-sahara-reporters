A 21-year-old young woman, Gloria Okolie, has perfected her bail conditions and regained her freedom. SaharaReporters learnt that she regained her freedom on Wednesday after over 150 days of illegal detention by the Nigerian police before being taken to court.  In all, she has spent over nine months in detention. Okolie was arrested and had been enslaved since June 17, 2021, by the operatives of the Inspector-General of Police’s Intelligence Response Team (IRT) in Imo State. Okolie was illegally detained and held in a cell by the Inspector-General of Police Intelligence Response Team unit of the Nigeria Police Force for months on allegations of spying for the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). SaharaReporters on November 23, 2021, reported that a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja granted bail to Gloria Okolie in the sum of N10million with two sureties. Ruling on the bail application, the presiding judge, Justice Taiwo Taiwo admitted her to bail with sureties one of whom must be at least a level-14 Civil Servant while the other must own landed property and must have lived at the present address for at least 2 years. Okolie who was accused of an offence bordering on terrorism was arrested by the Nigeria Police Force for allegedly being friends with a suspected member of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). She was later transferred to Abuja, despite efforts by her family members to secure her release. While reacting to the bail conditions her lawyers, Ihensekhien Samuel commended the judge for admitting her to bail though the terms were stringent but they would apply for variation in due course. Okolie and her co-defendant had remained in Suleja Correctional Centre custody pending the fulfilment of their bail conditions.
