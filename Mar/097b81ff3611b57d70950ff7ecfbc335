In the ensuing melee, the two sisters identified as Nurayn, 16 and Khadija, 11, were hit by stray bullets while they were also fleeing the scene. Salisu Shuaibu Kidanda, who is the victims' older brother said that they were killed by the bullets fired by the soldiers into the crowd, Daily Trust reports. “Even if they (soldiers) aimed at the Fulani they saw at the market, why will they shoot into the crowd? My sisters were trying to run back home because the market is on the outskirts of the village when they were hit by bullets. “As we speak, the soldiers didn’t even visit our parents to condole with us for their action, only the police did. We need justice because you can’t kill innocent girls just like that and leave,” he said. Another resident also said the Fulani men the soldiers were aiming at escaped into the bush.
