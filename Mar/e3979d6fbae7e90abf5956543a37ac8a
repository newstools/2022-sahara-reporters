A survivor of the Kaduna bound train attack has said some of the police escorts ran into the toilets to hide when terrorists opened fire on the train on Monday evening.  The survivor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told SaharaReporters on the phone on Tuesday how police escorts on the train ran into the toilets to hide the moment the attackers opened fire.  She said the pandemonium on the train during the tragic incident forced people to scamper for safety anywhere available, adding that the weapons used by the terrorists were more sophisticated than the ones with the policemen on board.  She said, "The police escorts on the train ran into the toilets and many passengers joined them. The terrorists came with sophisticated weapons which scared the police."  She described her escape as an act of God, saying she hid under the seats while the bullets were flying over her head.
