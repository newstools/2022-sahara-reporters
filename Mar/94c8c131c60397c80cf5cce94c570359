Andrew Nice Omininikoron, driver of the bus rapid transit (BRT) vehicle arrested in connection with the death of 22-year-old Bamise Ayanwole, will be arraigned in court today, SaharaReporters learnt.  According to a media advisory issued by Ayo Ademiluyi, lead counsel for the deceased's family, the suspect will appear before the Yaba Magistrate’s Court at noon on Friday.  The advisory reads, “The arraignment of Andrew Nice, the BRT driver that was arrested in connection with the murder of late Bamishe Ayanwola comes up today at Yaba Magistrate Court.”  Bamise went missing after she boarded a BRT vehicle from Chevron Bus Stop, Ajah to Oshodi around 7 pm on February 26.  During the journey, the fashion designer was said to have observed that the driver was not picking up other passengers at subsequent bus stops along the route.  Disturbed, she messaged her friend and sent voice notes detailing her predicament. It was the last time her friend and family members heard from her and she was later declared missing.  On Monday, she was found dead on Carter Bridge, according to the Lagos State Police Command.  The police subsequently picked up the bus driver, Nice Andrew Omininikoron, who has since remained in their custody.
