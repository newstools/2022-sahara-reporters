An Osun State High Court sitting in Osogbo, Osun State Capital, has remanded the owner of Hilton Hotels and Resorts, Dr. Ramon Adegoke Adedoyin, over the death of Timothy Adegoke, a postgraduate student at Obafemi Awolowo University. Adegoke and some other suspects were on Thursday arraigned before the court for allegedly murdering the postgraduate student in November 2021.  The development followed a letter to the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, by Senior Advocate of Nigeria and counsel for the family of the victim, Femi Falana, for the trial to be moved to Osogbo from Abuja since the crime took place in Osun State. There was confusion at the premises of Osun State High Court, Osogbo on Thursday as the family of murdered master’s student of the Obafemi Awolowo University, Timothy Adegoke Thursday clashed with that of Dr Ramon Adedoyin, the owner of Hiltons Hotel, Ile-Ife.

 Adedoyin and six others are being prosecuted at the court over the murder of Adegoke. Some family members of the deceased after the court sitting on Thursday accused the police of being biased. “The police have collected money, they didn’t allow him to talk to even journalists, check my face very well, I said so,” one of them said. Adegoke had lodged in Hilton Hotels and Resorts at Ile-Ife upon his arrival from Abuja on November 5 to enable him to arrive early for his examination at the OAU Distance Learning Centre, Moro, Osun State, on November 6 and November 7. He later went missing and was found dead buried in a grave following a police investigation of the hotel owner, Dr Rahman Adedoyin and its workers. After Adegoke was declared missing, the police were invited and seven suspects were arrested after which investigation commenced.
