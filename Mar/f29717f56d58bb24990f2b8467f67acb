At least seven soldiers of the Nigerian Army and more than 20 terrorists were killed during an attack by gunmen on Kabo Village in the Gurara Local Government Area of Niger State on Tuesday.  The terrorists, who earlier attacked the village on Monday and killed three persons, returned to the community on Tuesday where they were engaged in a gunfight with Nigerian Army personnel. SaharaReporters Media SaharaReporters reliably gathered that apart from the soldiers and terrorists killed during Tuesday's incident, the number of civilian deaths rose from three on Monday to about 12.  The development has forced more residents of the community to abandon their homes for other parts of the state considered to be relatively safe.  Terrorists suspected to be Fulani herders arrived in Kabo village in large numbers on Monday afternoon, shooting sporadically in different directions.  Most residents of the village were said to have been hit by bullets while fleeing into nearby bushes for safety. When contacted by SaharaReporters over the development, the spokesperson for the police in Niger State, Mr Wasiu Abiodun, promised to get back with details and updates on the situation but had yet to do so as of the time of filing this report.  On March 17, 2022, armed men killed a police officer during an attack on Bangi Divisional Headquarters in the Mariga Local Government Area of the state.  A day before that incident, bandits killed four police officers including a divisional police officer, Muhammad Umar, and four vigilantes in the Magama council area of the state.
