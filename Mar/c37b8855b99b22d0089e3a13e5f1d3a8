There is growing anxiety in the camp of former Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu after President Muhammadu Buhari shunned the ex-governor during his (Buhari’s) visit to Lagos State on Tuesday.SaharaReporters learnt that Buhari did not give Tinubu any attention – a rarity particularly considering the ruling party, All Progressives Congress' national convention in Abuja is just days away. Top sources around the President added that Tinubu was also not allowed near Buhari – a body language suggestive of another round of discord between the two.SaharaReporters on Tuesday reported that Buhari and his entourage landed at the Presidential Wing of the Murtala Muhammed Airport, Lagos at 10 am on Tuesday, amid tight security.The President had arrived aboard a Nigerian Air Force Boeing aircraft with registration number 5N-FGT and was welcomed by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and some members of the Lagos State Executive Council.He had later boarded a chopper to Lekki, where he inaugurated the multi-billion dollars Dangote Fertiliser Plant.President Buhari was also at the ongoing construction at the Dangote Refinery, as well as the Lekki Deep Sea Port. One of the top sources revealed that Buhari did not give Tinubu any attention during the visit, an obvious public snub that was pregnant with meanings.“It was a complete disgrace. He was not allowed near him. We believed they never exchanged greetings. And this is coming days before the APC convention in Abuja,” one of the sources said."You can see from the pictures taken at the event that Tinubu was not even close to the President. They made sure he was not close enough to the President to allow for chit-chat," another source said. Speaking at the inauguration of the new Terminal Building, Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos, Buhari had tasked the Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, to fast-track the airport concession programme, to boost aviation practice in the country and make the aviation industry reflect global standards.Tinubu had about two months ago gone to meet Buhari in Abuja, informing him about his 2023 presidential ambition, saying it was his “lifelong ambition.”In the APC circles, up to five other presidential aspirants have emerged although some party members believe that Tinubu stands taller than them, with his influence as the APC National Leader.
