Southern political leaders under the aegis of the Southern and Middle Belt Leaders’ Forum have called for the release of leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu.  The group described the charges of terrorism and treasonable felony against Kanu by the Nigerian Government as provocative and showed the double standards of the President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration.  The IPOB leader has been detained in the facility of Nigeria’s secret police, the Department of State Services, for 258 days having been arrested since June 27, 2021.  The group also demanded a stop to any further prosecution of Yoruba Nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemo (Sunday Igboho), who is currently on a ‘conditional release’ in Benin Republic.  They alleged that the Nigerian Government had no moral right to continue the prosecution of the freedom fighters while Boko Haram terrorists were being given ‘VIP treatment’ by the regime.  SMBLF made the call in a communiqué jointly signed by leaders of Yoruba’s Afenifere, Igbo’s Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the Middle Belt Forum, and the Pan Niger Delta Forum after a meeting in Abuja.  The communique reads partly, “The continued detention and trial of Nnamdi Kanu on charges of terrorism and treasonable felony while known Boko Haram terrorists are being given VIP treatments and hosted in government houses is not only provocative and perfidious but a bizarre double standard on the part of the Nigerian state.  “We demand, in national interest, the immediate release of Nnamdi Kanu and a stop to any further persecution of Sunday Igboho, who is currently on a conditional release in Benin Republic.”
