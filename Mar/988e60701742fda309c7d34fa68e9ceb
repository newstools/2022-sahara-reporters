The Nigerian Army says troops of Operation Desert Sanity have killed an unspecified number of Boko Haram (BH) and Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) terrorists in Borno State. According to the army on its Twitter page, several enclaves of the terrorists around Ukuba and Zairo in Sambisa forest were also destroyed.  “Ongoing offensive clearance operations records another feat as troops of Operation Desert Sanity destroyed ISWAP/BokoHaram enclaves around Ukuba & Camp Zairo in Sambisa forest, Borno State. Several terrorists were neutralized as troops recovered equipment & weapons,” the army tweeted. Since the death of JAS leader, Abubakar Shekau, ISWAP has been consolidating its grip in locations around Lake Chad. Last year, it appointed Wali Sani Shuwaram, a 45-year-old as the new Leader (Wali) of ISWAP in Lake Chad. Nigerian forces obliterated Shuwaram at a hideout around Kirta Wulgo near the Marte Local Government Area of Borno State recently. Bako Gorgore, a top ISWAP commander was said to be in line to become the new leader. Shuwaram died months after installation in Kurnawa, Lake Chad. The sect’s membership has swollen with the defection of hundreds of Boko Haram fighters under Shekau. The terror group has caused over 300,000 deaths and displaced millions of people mainly in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe states.
