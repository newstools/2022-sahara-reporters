A human rights activist, Deji Adeyanju, who is also convener of Concerned Nigerians group, on Thursday said the wife of outgoing Governor of Anambra State, Ebelechukwu Obiano; and widow of the late Chukwuemeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu, Bianca acted as thugs when the two women publicly fought at the inauguration of Chukwuma Soludo as the governor of the state. Adeyanju also said the two women should be arrested by the police for breach of public peace, noting that both Bianca and Ebelechukwu set a bad precedent for young ladies present at the event.The activist spoke in a chat with Punch while reacting to the clash of the two women at the Government House, Agu-Awka, Awka, the state capital.He said, “The police should arrest and charge the two women for disturbance of public peace. They are thugs. What has happened is a bad precedent for young women. It is unfortunate that these are the people we have up there. The loss of values is so obvious. It is sad.”When contacted on whether the police would invite both women on the account of disturbance of public peace, the spokesman for the police in Anambra, Ikenga Tochukwu, told Punch to send him a text message.The PPRO was yet to reply to the text message sent to him as of press time.The two long-feuding women locked horns at the event on Thursday and exchanged slaps before cameras. The development made the outgoing governor, Willie and his wife to abruptly leave the venue of the swearing-in ceremony of Soludo.
