A masked burglar has broken into the Beckham family home in West London and made thousands of pounds' worth of valuables. The thief forced their way into an upstairs bedroom at the £40m mansion in Holland Park and ransacked the place while David, Victoria and 10-year-old daughter Harper relaxed downstairs completely unawares, Daily Mail reports.  The break-in was not discovered until Wednesday morning when 17-year-old Cruz returned home from a night out and stumbled upon the upturned bedroom and spotted broken glass.  David, 46, reportedly called 999 and set about searching the mansion for the burglar with Cruz, while Harper remained with Victoria, 47, and waited for the police.  A source close to the family told The Sun: 'Sadly the Beckhams were the victims of some fairly professional thieves who have been operating in the area.  'Fortunately the criminals only made it as far as one bedroom before they ran off.'  The family are said to have been 'shaken up' by the burglary, but no one was hurt.  The thief made off with thousands in designer clothes, accessories and electric goods stored in the room - but did not hang around for more.
