According to the memo, all federal offices are to be shut by 1 pm tomorrow (Tuesday) as there is a need to mobilise support for the Nigerian team ahead of the Super Eagles FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 playoff final battle against the Black Stars of Ghana at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium. The memo, which is addressed to all Permanent Secretaries, reads, “As you are aware, the Super Eagles of Nigeria will be meeting the Black Stars of Ghana in continuation of the 2022 FIFA World-Cup Qualifier, Playoff, (Return Leg).“There is a need to mobilise support for the Nigerian Team.
