A policeman attached to a politician has lost his service pistol to political thugs and hoodlums, who invaded Eagle Square, venue of the All Progressives Congress national convention on Saturday. The incident happened when the thugs forced their ways into the convention venue.  The hoodlums took advantage of the poor security arrangement and pushed down the barrier, leading to commotion at the venue. The ensuing stampede left many people with varying degrees of injuries. Meanwhile, dozens of thugs were arrested by the police with knives, charms and other dangerous weapons at the venue of the convention. Security operatives including personnel of the Nigeria Police Force, Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps and Departments of State Services were overwhelmed by the thugs.
