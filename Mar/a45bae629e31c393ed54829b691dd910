Hassan Dauda, a former Special Assistant to the Chairman, Giwa Local Council, Kaduna State, has bagged a 12-year jail term for his involvement in N6.3m Hajj fraud. The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) charged Dauda before the Kaduna State High Court for allegedly defrauding eight persons of N6,342,000, NAN reports.  ICPC had, in a charge of 16 counts including obtaining by false pretence, abuse of office and forgery filed before Justice M. T. Aliyu, accused Dauda of using his position as a Special Assistant to the Chairman of Giwa Local Council to defraud unsuspecting victims in the guise of securing Hajj seats for them in 2013, an offence punishable under Section 19 of the Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act 2000. In his ruling, Justice Aliyu sentenced Dauda to 7 years imprisonment without an option of a fine. Dauda was also convicted on the counts relating to abuse of office and got five years imprisonment without an option of fine, a statement from the ICPC spokesperson, Azuka Ogugua, noted. He was discharged and acquitted on the counts relating to forgery. Reading the sentence, the judge stated that ICPC was able to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, adding that the sentence would run concurrently. The convict was arrested by ICPC operatives in October 2013 following a petition and was arraigned in May 2015 after the conclusion of investigations.
