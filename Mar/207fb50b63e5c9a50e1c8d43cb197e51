Ahead of the 2023 general elections, some chieftains of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) including the immediate past Governor of Gombe State, Ibrahim Hassan Dankwambo has visited his predecessor, Senator Danjuma Goje at his Abuja residence to woo him back to the party. Dankwambo was accompanied by the Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike; Senate Deputy Minority Leader, Philip Aduda; former Ekiti State governor, Ayo Fayose, and former member of the House of Representatives, JC to the Asokoro House of Goje.  It was gathered that the meeting which was held closed-door, was to lobby Goje to return to the PDP. Goje, a former Minister of Power, was also the governor of Gombe State between 2003 and 2011 under the PDP before he was succeeded by Ibrahim Dankwambo. Goje had decamped to the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC in the build-up to the 2015 general elections. A Federal High Court sitting in Jos had in March 219 quashed 19 out of the 21 counts of alleged N25 billion conspiracy and money laundering filed against Goje. In July 2019, a Federal High Court in Jos discharged Goje of the corruption charges filed against him. This came after the office of the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) applied for the withdrawal of the charges on Friday. Goje was being prosecuted by the anti-graft agency, EFCC, for allegedly mismanaging funds of Gombe State as governor. The EFCC withdrew from the matter when Goje agreed to step down for Ahmed Lawan as Senate President.
