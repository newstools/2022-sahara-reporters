Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky has warned Western countries that Russia would come for them after they finish with Ukraine. Zelensky said the war will not stop at Ukraine, insisting that the attack on Ukraine’s freedom will affect the rest of the world.  Zelensky spoke to ABC World News on Monday night, calling on U.S and the rest of NATO to secure Ukraine’s airspace “We cannot allow Russia to be active there only, because they’re bombing us, they are shelling us, they are sending missiles, helicopters, jet fighters — a lot of things,” Zelensky said. “We don’t control our sky.” The Ukraine leader said he believed so much in the United States’ President, Joe Biden’s ability to stop Russia from killing his people and destroying their land, adding that the American leader could do more to protect Ukraine. Biden “can do more” to stop the war. “I am sure he can and I would like to believe that. He is capable of doing that,” Zelensky said. The US and NATO have vowed never to create a no-fly zone in Ukraine. They maintained that such an action could lead to “full-fledged war in Europe.” On the other hand, President Vladimir Putin of Russia had issued a stern warning to the world, saying that any country that decided to impose such a no-fly zone would be considered to be participating in the conflict. And just yesterday, the White House maintained that Biden had no such plan in mind and was committed to keeping US troops out of the conflict. But Zelensky warned the war would affect the rest of the world. “Everyone thinks that we are far away from America or Canada. No, we are in this zone of freedom. And when the limits of rights and freedoms are being violated and stepped on, then you have to protect us, because we will come first. “You will come second. Because the more this beast will eat, he wants more, more, and more,” he said.
