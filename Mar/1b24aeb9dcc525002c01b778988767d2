Some Christian clerics from the Northern part of Nigeria have announced plans to hold a one-million-man prayer rally for an All Progressives Congress party presidential aspirant and former Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu. The group led by one Bishop Sunday Garuba said the move is divine.  In a statement on Tuesday, Garuba stated that Tinubu’s ambitions may ultimately collapse if not given the necessary spiritual support. But Garuba said Tinubu’s quest could be hampered by evil forces who did not mean well for the nation, hence the need for the one-day spiritual exercise. “Now the Lord said to Samuel, How long will you grieve over Saul, since I have rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and go; I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have selected a king for myself among his sons,” he said. “In less than one year, a new president will emerge to forge a new course for the nation. After over three months of immense prayer and fast, it has been revealed to us that Bola Ahmed Tinubu is our next leader. “God has never failed. He keeps his promises and honours his words more than his name. We are more than confident that Asiwaju will triumph. “But this can only be possible if we intercede and supplicate on his behalf. As we all know, the physical is controlled by the spiritual. “For this reason, we have taken it upon ourselves to hold a groundbreaking prayer rally. When we gather, we will join forces to fortify his aspirations for the good of the nation. “On behalf of other God’s generals, I invite all well-meaning Nigerians to join this movement. I assure you that this is for the good and progress of our dear nation. God bless you.”
