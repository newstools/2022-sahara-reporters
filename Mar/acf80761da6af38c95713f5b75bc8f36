Deji Adeyanju, activist and convener of the Concerned Nigerians group has taken a swipe at President Muhammadu Buhari and his series of campaigns under the All Progressives Congress. In a statement on Thursday, Adeyanju, while reacting to the recent killing of soldiers in Kebbi State amid other terrorist activities, said it is a “bloody stain on Buhari's inglorious garment of next level governance and anti-corruption regime, and APC's change mantra". SaharaReporters had reported that bandits killed 20 security operatives, including 15 soldiers, in Kebbi State. The soldiers from the Light Tank Battalion of the Nigerian Army in Zuru were deployed to Kanya, a village in Danko-Wasagu district following the killing of 68 vigilantes otherwise known as Yan Sakai by gunmen fleeing from Niger State. The gunmen in their hundreds invaded the community on Tuesday evening, engaging the soldiers and police officers in a three-hour gunfight, killing 20 of them. The gunmen also burnt about two military operational vehicles. Reacting to the incident, Adeyanju said, "Buhari's body language is the biggest enabler of bloody killings in Nigeria. And it is shocking because this was once a presidential aspirant who marched on the streets of Abuja weeping and mourning that we're suffering and dying, and he wants to help. “We all at Concerned Nigerians condemn these brutal attacks and killing of innocent people including security operatives. And we call on the government to wake from their slumber and rid the nation of these killers. Our condolences to the families who lost their loved ones in the attacks.”
