At least 10 people have died after Russian troops reportedly opened fire on Ukrainian civilians queueing for bread in the northern city of Chernihiv.  The report was contained in a tweet posted Wednesday to the official Twitter handle of the United States Embassy in Kyiv.  Horror footage also shows bodies lying on the ground after Russian soldiers allegedly shot them outside a bakery in the city.  “Today, Russian forces shot and killed 10 people standing in line for bread in Chernihiv. Such horrific attacks must stop. We are considering all available options to ensure accountability for any atrocity crimes in Ukraine,” the embassy wrote.  Russia has continued with its bombardment of Ukraine targeting military formations and civilian apartments.  No fewer than 100 children have been reportedly killed by Russian troops in the war. Russia on February 24 invaded Ukraine after it accused the latter of attempting to bring danger to its doorstep through its move to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO. NATO, also called the North Atlantic Alliance, is an intergovernmental military alliance among 28 European countries and 2 North American countries.
