This is a high form of injustice against Barrister Marshal. "We join well-meaning Nigerians to demand the immediate and unconditional release of Barrister Marshal. This is an attack on his democratic rights and we condemn it in totality. "The suffering people will rise to defend their dignity despite continued police intimidation and harassment. We stand solidly with Barrister Marshal and demand that the police stop this unprofessional manner which is capable of causing tension."Sowore had during the week filed a lawsuit against Nwoko and the Nigeria Police Force over his illegal arrest and detention last Thursday. The activist was illegally arrested by the police on the Court of Appeal premises on the orders of the former lawmaker over some trumped-up allegations. Among other things, Sowore also demanded an apology to be published in two reputable national daily newspapers for the violation of his fundamental rights and N200million as damages for the violation of his rights.
