Youths of Umugama village in Ukwulu Community of the Dunukofia Local Government Area, Anambra State, on Friday, blocked the gate to the Anambra State Police Command headquarters while protesting alleged land-grabbing by their monarch, Igwe Peter Uyanwa.The aggrieved youths alleged that their monarch Uyanwa sold off their lands adding that he had been using police operatives to arrest and lock up members of the community who dared to oppose his decision. Led by Philip Dilibe, the young people chanted derogatory songs asking their ruler to leave their lands for them as they held placards with various inscriptions.Some of the placards read, “Stop violence in Umugama,” “Igwe Ezedike stop selling our lands,” “We need peace in our land, not violence.”Addressing the youths, the representative of the Commissioner of Police and the police spokesman, Ikenga Tochukwu, advised the protesters to get an Attorney to articulate their grievances in the form of a petition and that the commissioner would work on it to ensure peace in the community.“We are happy that you are protesting peacefully, and we want to assure you that the commissioner will look into your petition once you write him formally and will ensure that investigation is carried out, and your grievances will be addressed,” Ikenga told the protesters.The protesters also marched to the zonal police command, Ukpo and the Palace of the clan head of Dunukofia, Igwe Robert C. Eze, Okofia VI.However, the traditional ruler of Ukwulu, Igwe Peter Uyanwa debunked the claims, in an interview, as he claimed he had nothing to do with the land belonging to Umugama village.He said, “That village is having their own crisis, and I’m not from that village, and I have nothing to do with their land, even though I’m their traditional ruler.“They even told me they wanted to protest at my palace today for me to settle the dispute they have, but I said no, I didn’t want to receive visitors. What you must know is that more than 80 per cent of the protesters are not my subjects; they were just hired for the protest. I don’t have even one plot of land in that village.”
