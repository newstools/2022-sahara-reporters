At least one trader has been reportedly killed and an unspecified number kidnapped when terrorists invaded a rural market in Chibani, a community in Munya Local Government Area of Niger State on Friday afternoon.  According to Daily Trust, the terrorists also reportedly invaded the Mararaban-Daudu community, also in the same local government and kidnapped residents.  A resident, Shehu Abubakar, said that the attackers launched the attack around 12pm when the market was filled to its capacity and operated for about three hours.  It was learnt that the terrorists carted away food items after the traders fled.  “We don’t know where many traders are right now because they haven’t started returning. A lot of goods were destroyed, apart from the ones they stole.  “Up till 5pm, traders had not gone back to the market to pick their goods. One person was killed and his remains taken to the police station at Sarkin Pawa,” he said.
