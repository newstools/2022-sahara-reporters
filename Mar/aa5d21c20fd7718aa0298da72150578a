A prominent traditional ruler in Osun State, Ogunsua of Modakeke, Oba Moses Oyediran, is dead. This was made known in a statement issued on behalf of the state government by the Commissioner for Information and Civic Orientation, Funke Egbemode. The statement described Oba Oyediran, who was of the Ajombadi Ruling House, as a God-fearing royal father who was an embodiment of wisdom and fairness. Egbemode in her statement recalled the monarch’s role in ensuring that peace was restored to the community when a communal clash broke out last year. The statement read in part, “The Government of Osun State hereby commiserates with the Ajombadi Ruling House, the people of Modakeke, the Council of Traditional Rulers and indeed the entire state over the demise of the Ogunsua of Modakeke, Oba Moses Oladejo Oyediran, Ajombadi III. “He will be forever remembered for his progressive ideology, peaceful demeanour and his love for the people of Modakeke during his little over three years on the stool of Ogunsua. “Though his reign was short, the late Ogunsua made his mark and did the best he could for his people. He had lofty expectations for the development of Modakeke, and he was fortunate to witness some of the interventions of the government to uplift the socio-economic and infrastructural status of the town, part of which was the reconstruction of Famia road. “When the peace of his community was threatened last year, he rose to the occasion and worked tirelessly with the Government to restore peace in Modakeke. He was a leader loved and respected by his people.”
