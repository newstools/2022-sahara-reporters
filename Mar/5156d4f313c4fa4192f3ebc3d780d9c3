Members of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) in Oyo State on Thursday asked the state governor, Seyi Makinde, to warn members of the motor park system in the state to avoid bloodshed.The union in a petition signed by its lawyer, Chief Michael Lana, said it was illegal for the members of the Park Management System in the state to be collecting union dues from the commercial drivers since the state government did not proscribe the activities of the union in the state.

According to the union, members of the Park Management System are threatening to kill NURTW members for visiting their own building located along Lagos to Iwo-Road area of Ibadan, the Oyo State capital.The petition further stated that despite the fact that Section 43 of the constitution of Federal Republic of Nigeria empowered members of the NURTW the right to own property, members of Motor Parks Management were threatening to kill them, if they visited their property.The petition which was copied the governor of the state, Seyi Makinde, the Commissioner of Police in the state and the Director of the Department of State Services reads;  "Our clients are the owners of the building lying and situated at plot 4 Aduloju Layout along Iwo-road, Ibadan. Our clients alleged that while on the inspection of the said building by the executive and the members of our clients today, March 24, 2022, their members were accosted by the so-called Park Managers wearing Mukaila Lamidi a.k.a auxiliary's Caps and T Shirt with picture of Governor Seyi Makinde."These miscreants threatened to attack our clients should they come to their office again boasting that they have the backing of the governor of the state and could not be arrested even if they killed any of our client's members."It is of note that in the above named suit, the governor of the state deposed that it did not proscribe our Client's union, therefore, there is no order or law preventing our Client from using their property."Kindly be informed that under section 43 of the constitution of Nigeria, our clients have the right to own the said property and no person has the right to own their property. Also, it has been established that the state government is not a trade union, therefore, neither it nor its agent has the right to collect the union's dues from commercial drivers and this is the subject of the above-named suit. However, our clients have copious evidence that the so-called managers are collecting the union dues from commercial drivers in the state."The law is that when a matter is pending before the court, neither the parties can do anything there on. Our clients have been law abiding since 2019 when your government handed over the park to Mukaila Lamidi Aka auxiliary thereby leaving our clients jobless and abject poverty."To avoid bloodshed in the state, it is better to warn Mukaila Lamidi to rein in his thugs and make no attempt to disturb our clients’ occupation of their office."It will also be in the interest of peace if you also warn the park managers and the local government in charge of collecting union dues from commercial drivers. We believe that as a man of peace, you will heed to our request."
