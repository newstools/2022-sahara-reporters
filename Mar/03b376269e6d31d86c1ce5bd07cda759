The Lagos State Chairman of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), Musiliu Akinsanya, popularly known as MC Oluomo, still retains his position, his spokesperson, Jimoh Buhari has said. According to Jimoh, his principal has yet to receive any letter from the national body ordering his suspension. In an earlier report, the leadership of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), in a letter, ordered the immediate suspension of MC Oluomo, over alleged misconduct and insubordination to the union's management. Oluomo's suspension was based on the premise that he incited members of the state chapter against the apex body, an act said to be against the NURTW constitution. The body had also directed MC Oluomo to immediately hand over the mantle of leadership to his deputy chairman and release all property belonging to the transport body in his possession to State Secretary, to avoid any leadership vacuum in the state. But Jimoh, in an interview with Punch, debunked the report as he noted that his principal had yet to be served any of such letter. He argued that the NURTW cannot sack any of its leaders on social media as he reiterated his earlier position that MC Oluomo is still the Lagos Chairman of the Union. He said: “As far as we are concerned, we are not aware of the suspension because we have not received any letter from the national leadership. “A leader of an organisation cannot be suspended on social media. “MC Oluomo is going into a meeting at the moment and he is going to chair the meeting. He remains Lagos NURTW chair.”
