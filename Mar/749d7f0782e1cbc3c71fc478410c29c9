A former Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II says his unrepentant attitude of speaking truth to power cost him his positions as governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and monarch of the ancient city of Kano. He disclosed this while speaking at the closing ceremony of the AIG Public Leadership Programme Class of 2021, in Abuja, on Wednesday.  Former President Goodluck Jonathan in April 2014 sacked Sanusi as CBN governor over claims that $49 billion was stolen by some persons under his government. He was also dethroned as Emir of Kano by Governor Abdullahi Ganduje on March 9, 2020. “I always stood to speak the truth to power, reason I was removed as CBN governor and Emir of Kano, but that did not stop me from doing what I see as the right thing,” Sanusi said. He lamented that civil servants have traded their conscience for personal gains. He added, “Today, you see civil servants stealing millions and billions of naira meant to build roads, provide power, water, education, food and transportation, to the detriment of the majority of Nigerians. All of these have given birth to Boko Haram, killer herdsmen, bandits and numerous arms struggles, especially among the youths, which resulted in the worst threats to human lives all over Nigeria.”
