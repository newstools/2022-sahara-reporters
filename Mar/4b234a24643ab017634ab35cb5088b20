A baker, Chinenye Opah, a native of Mgbowo, in the Awgu Local Government Area of Enugu State, has been shot dead. Although the reason for the killing of the young lady had yet to be ascertained, sources told Punch on Monday that the incident happened on Ologo Street in the Coal Camp suburb of the state capital on Friday, March 18, 2022.  An eyewitness, who spoke on condition of anonymity, alleged that the shooter was an operative of the Department of State Services. “The operatives stormed the location in two Hilux vehicles and started shooting sporadically, causing a stampede. “In the ensuing commotion, one of them pursued Chinenye, who ran like every other person for safety; then he gunned her down. The operative shot her several times at close range. “The matter was reported at the Uwani Police Station and some police officers visited the scene of the incident, recovered some spent bullets and took the corpse to the Eastern Nigeria Medical Centre mortuary,” the source added. Another source said the operatives were trailing two fleeing suspects before the mother of one was gunned down. Meanwhile, a family source said Chinenye had three bullet holes in her upper region, adding that the matter was also reported at the Ekirike Police Station. “Our family will visit the DSS office tomorrow (Tuesday) to lodge an official complaint. The family couldn’t do so before now because the incident happened on a weekend and there has not been a working day since then,” the source added. The victim’s uncle, Justus Opah, affirmed that Chinenye was killed by the DSS, adding that several residents witnessed the incident. The state police spokesman, Daniel Ndukwe, did not take his calls or respond to text messages on the incident. The DSS spokesperson, Peter Afunanya, however, denied the incident. He said, “This is not true. It is completely misleading information.”
