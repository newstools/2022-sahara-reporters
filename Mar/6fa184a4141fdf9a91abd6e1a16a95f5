The Nigerian police authorities have launched an operation to clampdown on officers planning to embark on industrial actions on Saturday. Some policemen had last week said they would embark on the warning strike to protest poor working conditions, poor salaries, lack of genuine welfare benefits and outdated weapons.  A protest tagged “We are tired of negligence” is also scheduled to be held at the Eagles Square in Abuja to reiterate their demands to the Nigerian government. The officers condemned the continuous killing of their colleagues by armed robbers and terrorists, without adequate compensation for their families. They accused the Nigerian government of lying about the increment of police salary and other promised benefits and demanded improved conditions of service, particularly salary increase and provision of modern weapons as they tackle the security challenges facing the country. Reacting, Inspector-General of Police, Mr Usman Baba, warned the officers against such action. According to Baba, a strike action by a lead security agency such as the police was tantamount to mutiny. However, the policemen insisted that there was no going back on the planned industrial action. A police signal exclusively obtained by SaharaReporters on Wednesday showed that one Inspector Adebimpe Olorundare had been arrested as one of the leaders of the aggrieved officers. Police source said Olorundare’s WhatsApp had also been diagnosed and more arrests would be made soon. “IN LINE WITH YIUR VERBAL DIRECTIVE REGARDING TRACKING ANALYSIS O/C SIB MINE X ARRESTED AP/NO 252426 INSPECTOR ADEBIMPE OLORUNDARE ‘M’ ATTACHED TO BOMBPOL BASE 14 JOS MINE WITH GSM NO 080607153** AND PRESENTLY ON HIS WAY TO FHQ ABUJA X WITH THE SUSPECT AS DIRECTED X ABOVE FOR YOUR INFORMATION FOR FURTHER DIRECTIVE X PLEASE XXXXXXXX XXXXXXX XXXXXX,” the signal read.
