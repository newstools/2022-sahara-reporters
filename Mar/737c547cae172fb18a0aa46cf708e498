A request by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency seeking the confiscation of the assets of the disgraced ‘super cop’, Abba Kyari and his co-accused, has been approved by the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami. Some weeks ago, the NDLEA made the demand in a letter to Malami following the March 7 arraignment of Kyari and his men for dealing in cocaine.  Punch reports that the request has now received the nod of the AGF. Kyari and the co-accused persons risk losing their assets, cash and money in bank accounts; vehicles; hotels, residential and commercial buildings; wristwatches, jewellery and other valuable possessions. Last week, it was reported that a combined N4.2 billion was traced to the separate accounts of the suspended 'super cop' and his deputy, ACP Sunday Ubua. SaharaReporters had reported that Kyari is facing eight counts of conspiracy, obstruction, and dealing in cocaine, and other related offences at the Federal High Court, Abuja. The other defendants are four members of the IRT, Ubua, Bawa James, Simon Agirigba and John Nuhu. Two civilian suspects arrested at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport in Enugu— Chibunna Patrick Umeibe and Emeka Alphonsus Ezenwanne—are also defendants. Kyari was earlier indicted in the United States for alleged involvement in a $1.1m scam carried out by an international Internet fraudster, Ramon Abass, aka Hushpuppi. He was suspended by the police last July to allow for investigation into the extent of his relationship with Hushpuppi.
