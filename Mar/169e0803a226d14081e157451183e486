Britain is searching out the helicopters and jets belonging to sanctioned Russian oligarchs including Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich. In the meantime, it has asked the Isle of Man to deregister Abramovich’s personal helicopter, Reuters reports.  Abramovich was among seven more oligarchs put under British sanctions on Thursday, meaning his assets, mainly property, private jets and helicopters will be frozen, with no financial transaction being able to take place in relation to them. The action also puts on ice Abramovich’s plans to sell Premier League club, Chelsea, effectively placing the current European champions under government control. The team can carry on playing but the government says it is open to selling the club so long as Abramovich himself did not benefit. An ally of Transport Minister, Grant Shapps, said, “Grant has ordered his officials to gather intelligence on suspect aircraft, including their ownership and flight plans. “If we find they belong to persons on the sanctions list or people resident in Russia they will be grounded. He’s calling time on the oligarchs’ flying gin palaces.”
