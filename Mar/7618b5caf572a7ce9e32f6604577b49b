Some foreign students of the Sumy State University, Ukraine have cried out for help, in a video shared online. The students, who are Africans, some of whom are Nigerians, said they have been stranded in their school, shuttling between hostels and bomb shelters whenever they get alerts of air raids.  According to a voice in the video, the students are already mentally exhausted and are seeking help to leave their current condition for a safer and saner environment.  They said, “We the students of Sumy State University, we are tired and we are exhausted. We are physically tired running up and down from our hostel rooms to the bomb shelters almost every three to four hours because we get alerts of air raids or street fights. “We are mentally exhausted thinking that the day we go out to buy food or at least stand in line to buy food, they may drop a bomb or a missile and we will not be able to get back to our hostels for us to find a way out to go home. ð¨: They are mentally and physically exhausted! theyjust want to leave!!!Whoever sees this, THEY NEED HELP!!!Lots of Congolese, Nigerian etc... students are stranded in Sumy and are gradually lacking financial means etc.THEY ARE ALL STRANDED IN SUMY#AfricansinUkraine pic.twitter.com/ke3ZSePLvH
