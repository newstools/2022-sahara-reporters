Residents of Chukuku in Kuje Area Council in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja on Thursday morning blocked the Gwagwalada-Kuje Road to protest against the incessant cases of kidnapping in the community. The protesters barricaded the road connecting Gwagwalada to Kuje as early as 6:00 am, preventing human and vehicular movements in the area.  SaharaReporters gathered that the residents became infuriated following the kidnapping of four persons including women in the community on Wednesday night. The gunmen were said to have raided the village in a Gestapo manner, shooting sporadically as residents scampered to find safety. This comes a few days after kidnappers stormed Yangoji community in Kwali Area Council, kidnapped two women and shot their father dead. Also, a young man was kidnapped in Petti village for three days but released after the payment of N3 million as ransom. Angry residents who are disturbed by the rate of killings, abductions and rustling in their communities vowed not to allow any vehicle on the road until the government addressed the security situation in the area. The residents blamed security agents for not being proactive in combating the menace despite the intelligence report being made available to the police. In a video obtained by SaharaReporters on Thursday, the motorists were seen tuning back as protesters insisted that no one would be allowed in and out of the community. Chukuku is a few kilometres away from Kuje, the headquarters of Kuje Area Council which has become the epicentre of abductions in the nation’s capital.
