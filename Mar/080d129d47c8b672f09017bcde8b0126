A young man in Ebonyi State, Wisdom Noble, has cried out for help after he was detained by the police in Ebonyi State for allegedly driving an exotic car. The young man who posted a video on social media said he had been recently involved in an accident after which he was admitted to the hospital.  Upon his discharge from the hospital, he said he proceeded to the police station to make a formal report of the incident. Unfortunately, he was detained by the officers who claimed he was too young to drive or own the car with which he got involved in an accident. Narrating his ordeal, Noble, who captured himself in the cell in a video said, “I had an accident, was admitted at the hospital; so I was later discharged. Afterwards, I came to the police station to make an entry. Instead, the police officers locked me up inside the cell in the morning, someone should help me please; this is pure intimidation. “The officer said I'm too young to drive a car and that he was expecting a big man with a big tummy. Young Nigerians don't have the right to drive cars?”
