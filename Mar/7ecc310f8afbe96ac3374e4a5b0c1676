United States President, Joe Biden, has called for Vladimir Putin's removal from power as he warned that if the Russian President's ambitions went unchecked, it could lead to decades of war in Europe. Biden in an emotional speech on Saturday said the Russian President “cannot remain in power”.  He said, “For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power." Biden stated this as he paid an emotional visit to some of the more than three million Ukrainians, who have been evacuated from their war-torn country. However, the White House moved to clear Biden's words, saying the President was not calling for regime change in Russia, according to a report by Daily Mail. “The President’s point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbours or the region. He was not discussing Putin’s power in Russia, or regime change,” a White House official said. In his speech, Biden drew a stark line between democracy and oppression as he accused the Russian President of dishonesty.
