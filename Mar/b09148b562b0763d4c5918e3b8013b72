The Kano State chapter of the Nigeria Labour Congress has condemned plans by the state government to cut the pay of workers for February by returning to the old salary scale. Kabiru Ado Minjibir, NLC Chairman in the state, said the congress has disassociated itself from what it described as a “government’s sabotage plan.” According to him, the government had informed labour that it could not pay the N30,000 minimum wage to workers due to a shortfall in the FAAC allocation accrued to the state. However, the union had met with the government and made three recommendations on how to go about the issue, adding that the government accepted two of them but turned down the one that has to do with the commitment of paying workers the shortfall in their salaries once the FAAC allocation of the state improves. “In line with these, we want to inform all workers in the state and the general public that the NLC and all leaders of other unions in the state disassociate itself from this decision,” he said. In his reaction, Kano State Commissioner for Information, Muhammad Garba, told Daily Trust that the government was facing a shortfall in revenue generation which he said bedevils most states. “We have been paying an extra N600 making N30,600 up to January. It was in February we saw that we have a serious problem with revenue generation and we sat with NLC and explained our problem to them and our decision to revert to what we can pay – the old salary scale,” he said.
