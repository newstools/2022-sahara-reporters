Eyewitnesses said the soldier who was said to be drunk, was with one of his colleagues at a military checkpoint in the town when the incident happened on Wednesday. About 16 people also sustained varying degrees of injury. “He opened fire and killed 7 on the spot, including a 3-yr-old girl. Sixteen others sustained gunshot wounds, 2 of whom also later died,” a resident of the community said.
