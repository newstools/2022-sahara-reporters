The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has released the former governor of Anambra State, Willie Obiano after he perfected his bail conditions. The former governor was arrested last week by the anti-corruption agency a few hours after handing over to the current governor, Charles Soludo.  He was given administrative bail on Wednesday evening. According to Daily Trust, Obiano’s passport was seized by the EFCC as part of his bail condition. Obiano was arrested last Thursday at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos while on his way to the United States of America. The EFCC spokesman had told our correspondent that Obiano was on their watch list prior to his arrest. The former governor was subsequently transferred to the headquarters of the commission, where he was quizzed for days over alleged mismanagement of N5 billion Sure-P money, N37 billion security vote, withdrawn in cash, as well as some inflated contracts. Soludo in an interview with Arise TV on Tuesday said he met only N300 million in the state’s treasury when he assumed office. He added that he also inherited over N100 billion in debt. Soludo said: “In terms of debt I inherited, it runs into hundreds of billions of Naira. In that of cash, we met about N300 million only. In fact, let’s not talk about it. Our treasury is funny. “I hope we shall make money henceforth to help us fulfil our promises for infrastructure and development of the state. “But in terms of what I met in our coffers, my brother, it’s pathetic. Please let us not go there. God will help us.”
