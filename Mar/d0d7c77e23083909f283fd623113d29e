Operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency have intercepted three million capsules of opioids at Jaelith Bonded Container Terminal under Tincan Seaport in Apapa, Lagos. The seizure of capsules of Tapentadol and Carisoprodol weighing 1,500 kilogrammes on Monday followed a similar operation in which personnel of the agency also intercepted 8,613 kilogrammes of Loud, a variant of Cannabis, smuggled in from Ghana through Eko Atlantic Beach, Victoria Island, Lagos.  The seized drugs at the bonded terminal were discovered during a joint examination of a container marked SUDU 7774749 with men of the Nigeria Customs Service, a statement by NDLEA’s Director of Media and Advocacy, Femi Babafemi, disclosed. Though the consignment was said to have originated from Ningbo Province in China and falsely labelled as containing 271 packages of insulating fittings, faucet water closet, industrial office printing machine, investigations revealed that information on the bill of laden and shipping documents was fake. Further investigations uncovered that the container originated from India and arrived at Apapa seaport in Nigeria on February 10, 2022. Findings showed that the Tramadol found and labelled as Tafrodol 120mg was actually Tapentadol, which is a more dangerous and potent opioid than Tramadol. It was also discovered that the container was consigned from Nhava Sheva seaport in India, moved through Morocco and Ghana to Nigeria. Meanwhile, based on credible intelligence, operatives of the Lagos command of the agency in the early hours of Sunday intercepted the consignment of Cannabis Sativa (Loud) weighing 8,613kg smuggled from Ghana through Eko Atlantic Beach, Victoria Island. Some drivers and their assistants including Adeyemi Bayioku, 31; Godwin Anya, 28; Yusuf Taofik, 20, and Adeniyi Adelaja, 19, who were on the ground to load the shipment into their vehicles were promptly arrested while two trucks, a Siena space bus, Peugeot Boxer bus and a Toyota Camry car were seized from them.
