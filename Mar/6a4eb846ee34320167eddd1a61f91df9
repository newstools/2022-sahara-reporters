An Islamic group, Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC), has hailed Nigerian police authorities for approving the use of hijab for policewomen. The group said the Force under the watch of the Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, has approved the use of hijab for the rank and file of its female workforce.  The group, while reacting to the development, described the approval as a landmark development and the beginning of a new dawn. This was contained in a statement issued on Friday, by the chairman of MURIC, Zamfara State Chapter, Professor Ahmad Galadima. Galadima described it as a landmark development in the history of the struggle for Muslim civil rights. According to the group, it is an open secret that female Muslims in police formations (including their army) in Britain, the United States, Canada, etc. use hijab with their uniforms. The statement reads in part: "The High Command of the Nigeria Police Force under the watch of the Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, has approved the use of hijab for the rank and file of its female workforce. "The approval is one of the efforts of the leadership of the NPF, to encourage freedom of worship and promotion of religious tolerance within the police force and by extension, the general public. However, its use is optional and must conform to the approved style and design. "This will be a welcome development to many Muslims and accords respect to the Nigeria Police Force. In many other countries of the world, especially in America, Canada, Britain, policewomen are allowed to wear Hijabs, as part of their uniforms. “MURIC hereby expresses deep appreciation to the Nigeria Police High Command, particularly the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Usman Alkali Baba for listening to the pleas and advocacies of MURIC and other Muslim groups which have been demanding the use of hijab in the security and uniformed agencies for decades.”
