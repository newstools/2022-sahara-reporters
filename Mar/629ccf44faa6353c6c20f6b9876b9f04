Parents and guardians of some students who recently graduated from the Landmark University, Omu-Aran, Kwara State have accused the management of the school of withholding the National Youth Service Corps scheme call-up letters of their children over their absence in a prayer session held to bid them farewell from the institution.  According to Vanguard, the parent alleged that the students were absent when the Chancellor of the university, Dr. David Oyedepo, came to pray for them.  “Sir, this issue may not be your business, but, I feel as an affairs analyst, you can add your voice to 200 families who are in pain,” a text message allegedly from one of the parents read.  “Our wards graduated from Landmark University, Omu-Aran, owned by Bishop Oyedepo. About 200 graduands were absent when Bishop David Oyedepo came to pray over them and he then instructed that their NYSC call-up letters be withheld.  “Delegates and letters of appeal have been sent with no response until yesterday, when I heard that call-up letters will be released in August 2022.  “It means our children will stay at home with us after graduation till August. This is rather draconian and height of impunity.”  When contacted, spokesman for Landmark University, Joseph Olajide said that affected students are faceless as far as he was concerned because he didn’t know those who protested.  Olajide, who said he did not want to be drawn into the issue of whether students were sanctioned or not for missing a prayer programme, explained that the parents ought to bring their grievances to the school instead of approaching the media.
