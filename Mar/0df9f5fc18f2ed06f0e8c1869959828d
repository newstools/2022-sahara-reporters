Victor Umeh, former Chairman of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, has narrated why Ambassador Bianca Ojukwu slapped Ebelechukwu, wife of Willie Obiano, former governor of Anambra state.A video had on Thursday surfaced showing how Bianca slapped the former Anambra First Lady. The scuffle occurred at the inauguration of Chukwuma Soludo, the new governor of the state.Soludo was sworn in at the Government House in Anambra.Dignitaries, including Obiano, were already seated when the altercation played out.In the viral video seen by SaharaReporters, Ebelechukwu stood up from her seat and moved to where Bianca, widow of Chukwuemeka Ojukwu, was seated and spoke to her.Although Ebelechukwu was inaudible, the video showed how Bianca rose and gave her a slap, leading to a commotion.The incident drew the attention of security agents and some personalities who pulled Obiano’s wife away from Bianca.Reacting in an interview with Arise TV, Umeh said Ebelechukwu verbally attacked the former Ambassador.He said, “Yesterday was not a pleasant day for us because we were at the inauguration ceremony of Professor Soludo as the governor-elect. Something unimaginable happened and it overshadowed the storyline yesterday.“From Ambassador Bianca's narrative, she was correct in her narration of what actually happened because we were all seated in good time for the event.“The former governor drove into the arena and when he alighted from his car, we noticed he didn't come with his wife. He came and exchanged pleasantries with everybody and went and sat down. Everything had gone on. The deputy governor had been sworn in.“The Chief Judge was on the verge of swearing in the new governor and midway into that ceremony of swearing in Governor Soludo, the former first lady came into the arena and walked to another place to sit down away from where the husband sat. We also observed that that was a strange situation. She ought to have gone to sit with her husband but she didn't do that.“The video footage has shown everything to everybody that she left where she was sitting and walked straight to where Ambassador Bianca was sitting calmly and started verbal attacks on her. I was seated away but within a very clear view.“When the exchange of blows as I would call it started, I had to rush to that place to restrain them and separate them to ensure that no harm was inflicted on Ambassador Bianca Ojukwu who was seated very calmly for that ceremony.”
