An herbalist, Alhaji Bala has been arraigned in court for allegedly printing fake naira notes in Adamawa State. SaharaReporters learnt that Bala was arrested after allegedly duping a businessman, Salisu Adamu of the sum of N1.3 million under the guise of printing N500 million for him to boost his business.  The herbalist reportedly collected the N1.3 million to purchase animals for sacrifice to pave the way for the money to be spent without being discovered as counterfeit. Adamu was introduced to the herbalist by another businessman, Ado Mohammed of Sabon Layi in Gombi town in the Gombi Local Government Area. Adamu was said to have informed Mohammed about his desire to get rich, promising to pay any price. Mohammed then told him about the herbalist, and the two agreed on a date to visit him (herbalist). On the agreed date, Mohammed urged the herbalist to print fake N500 million for him. "After agreeing to pay me the sum of N1.3 million, I took him on a tour of my operating room where he saw a drum filled with N1,000 denomination of fake currency; I assured him I'll get to work immediately to print his N500 million. "But I couldn't deliver as promised, leading to a hide and seek’ game between me and him," the herbalist narrated. Bala was apprehended following a complaint lodged by Adamu at a police station. As things stand, Bala, who was charged before a Chief Magistrate Court I in Yola, has pleaded guilty as charged. The offence is contrary to sections 60 and 317 of the penal code law of Adamawa State. After his guilty plea, the judge, Muhammed Abdullahi Digil, ordered that the defendant be remanded in prison custody and subsequently adjourned the matter to March 30, 2022.
