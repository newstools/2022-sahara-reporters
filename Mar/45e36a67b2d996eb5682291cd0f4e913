Ukraine Defence Minister, Oleksii Resnikov, has offered Russian soldiers money and immunity from punishment if they surrender. Resnikov made the call on Tuesday on Facebook, urging them to “Make your decision, come out without weapon, with a white flag.”  





According to the report, each soldier was being offered the equivalent of more than $40,000.The campaign was reportedly being financed by the international IT industry.“Anyone who refuses to be an occupationist will bring peace. For those who choose the path of the occupationist, there will be no mercy!” said Resnikov.Whether surrendering Russians will actually receive the money could not be verified.According to Ukrainian sources, at least 200 Russian soldiers have been captured so far.
