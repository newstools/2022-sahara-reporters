A police officer attached to the now-defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad, who was dismissed from the Nigeria Police Force in 2018 over armed robbery, kidnapping and other crimes, has now been restored to the force without trial, human rights activist, Harrison Gwamnishu revealed.Gwamnishu, who founder of Behind Bars Foundation, in a statement said the Police Service Commission has to explain how the dismissed officer found his way back to the force. While Gwamnishu did not mention the name of the officer, recall that in 2018, the police announced the dismissal of four policemen attached to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, Ikeja, Lagos State, over robbery and other crimes.The then Assistant Inspector-General of Police in charge of Zone 2 Command, Adamu Ibrahim, was reported to have approved the dismissal.The dismissed officers included Sgt. Adeoye Adekunle, Sgt. Adekitan Adebowale, Sgt. Agbi Lucky and Sgt. Odighe Hehosa.The police said the four policemen were dismissed and subsequently charged to court for armed robbery, kidnapping, unlawful detention and intimidation, as well as threatening violence.The panel had recommended the four officers for dismissal based on the report of the investigation carried out on a petition against them by one Mr Chukwudi Godwin Odionye, popularly referred to as ‘Bishop’.A statement from the police read, “The petitioner stated that on June 4, 2017, he was in his house around Alagbado area of the state when four armed men stormed his house to effect his arrest on the allegation of performing ‘fake’ miracles.“He stated that after his arrest, he was taken to one hotel at Agege, where he was detained and threatened to be killed if he failed to cooperate.“He explained further that the following day, June 5, 2017, he was taken to the bank where he was made to transfer N7million to the account of one of the operatives.”
