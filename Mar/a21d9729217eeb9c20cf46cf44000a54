The Russian fighter pilots flying sorties in Ukraine have been warned by the President, Volodymyr Zelensky, that they will face justice. Zelensky who made this known on Wednesday affirmed that “You will be held accountable one way or another,” according to the News Agency of Nigeria.  He mentioned a Russian fighter jet shot down by Ukrainian forces over the besieged city of Mariupol, as an example. He said that Russian pilots apparently have no idea of the gravity of the orders they are carrying out. He said “Today or tomorrow, it doesn’t matter that much. The important thing is that it’s inevitable.” “And this will happen to anyone who kills our people, peaceful people in our peaceful country,” the Ukrainian president said. “The killing of civilians is a crime,” he added. Ukraine claims to have shot down about 100 Russian fighter planes and bombers since Russia invaded its western neighbour nearly four weeks ago.
