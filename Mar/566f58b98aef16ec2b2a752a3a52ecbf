The Controller of Kirikiri Correctional Centre, Mrs Lizzie Ekpendu has been redeployed over the beauty pageant conducted in the female section of the facility which was won by murder suspect Chidinma Ojukwu. Chidinma is the prime suspect in the murder of Micheal Usifo Ataga, the CEO of Super TV. She was crowned Miss Cell 2022 at the beauty contest organised by the prison authorities to commemorate International Women’s Day, which generated public outrage.  According to Vanguard, Mrs Ekpendu was redeployed last week over the fall-out of the pageant. A source told the newspaper that Mrs Ekpendu was redeployed to the Lagos Command Headquarters, Alagbon, Ikoyi. Ojukwu had allegedly stabbed her victim to death after they checked into an apartment in Lekki, Lagos. She subsequently fled the crime scene and was later arrested by the police. She and other suspects who were arrested in connection with the incident have been standing trial over the murder of Usifo Ataga.
