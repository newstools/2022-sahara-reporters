The Governor of Yobe State and embattled Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Mai Mala Buni, deliberately planned to disrupt the party's national convention scheduled for March 26, TheCable has learnt.The ruling party had been engulfed in crisis since last year crisis over who emerges its national chairman and convention date. Buni has been intentionally foot-dragging on preparations and issues for the convention to remain as the national leader of the party.It was revealed that the governor and John Akpanudoedehe, national secretary of the APC caretaker committee, used a third party to obtain a court order temporarily restraining the ruling party from holding its convention until a substantive suit has been heard and determined.The suit, filed by one Salisu Umoru at the high court in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, had the APC and Buni as respondents.The court document read: "That the 1st Defendant/Respondent can only conduct its national convention after the hearing and determination of the substantive suit pending before this honourable court.“That in the interest of justice accelerated hearing of the substantive suit is hereby ordered.“That this matter is hereby adjourned to the 10th day of January 2022 for hearing of the substantive suit at High Court No. 15, Kubwa, FCT-Abuja.”It is understood that got to know about the plot about a week ago.This, it was learnt, informed Buhari's decision to replace him with Abubakar Sani Bello, governor of Niger State.“The President asked the Niger governor to replace Buni when he became aware of the document,” a source familiar with the issue was quoted as saying.“Buni and Akpanudoedehe who is the national secretary will have to vacate their offices immediately.”Speaking with reporters at the APC National Secretariat in Abuja on Monday, Bello said he has been acting as the party’s chairman “for a while.”Buhari’s decision, it was gathered, has made several governors backing Buni to ditch him.Muhammad Badaru, Jigawa governor; Nasir el-Rufai, Kaduna governor; Atiku Bagudu, Kebbi governor; and Yahaya Bello, Kogi governor, are believed to have turned their backs on Buni, another source said.“Buni does not have anybody to speak for him now. The APC governors who supported him have taken sides with Mr President,” the source added.
