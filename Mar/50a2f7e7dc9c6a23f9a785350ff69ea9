A clergy with the Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA), Rev Yohana Joshua, and two sons of a former secretary of the Local Education Authority (LEA) in Kuje Area Council of the FCT, Danladi Bulus, have been abducted by suspected kidnappers. The two abducted siblings are Felix Bulus and Victor Bulus.  They were kidnapped on Tuesday at Godoji community of the council. Daily Trust gathered that this was the third time the kidnappers would attack the ex- education scribe in the last two years. The former education scribe, Danladi Bulus, who confirmed the latest incident while speaking with our reporter through telephone yesterday, said it happened around 12am. Bulus said he was told that the kidnappers came in their large numbers wielding AK-47 rifles and gained access into his house by breaking the fence, noting that he was not home when they attacked. He further said the kidnappers proceeded to the pastor’s house and also whisked him away. He added that, “No contact has been established with the kidnappers.” Reacting, the spokesperson of the FCT police command, DSP Adeh Josephine, said she hated to admit that such incident happened.
