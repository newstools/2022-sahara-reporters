The former Central Bank Governor added that inherited debts running into “hundreds of billions of naira” from his predecessor, Willie Obiano.Soludo said, “In terms of debt I inherited, it runs into hundreds of billions of Naira. In that of cash, we met about N300million only. In fact, let’s not talk about it. Our treasury is funny. I hope we shall make money henceforth to help us fulfill our promises for infrastructure and development of the state.“But in terms of what I met in our coffers, my brother, it’s pathetic. Please let us not go there. God will help us.”Obiano was apprehended by operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) as he tried to leave the country few hours after he handed over to Soludo.
