Two Katsina female teenagers, Mubaraka Naziru and Amina Rabiu, who escaped from their abductors recently, have narrated their ordeal while in captivity.Katsina is one of the North-West states badly hit by banditry. The situation has led to tens of internally displaced persons camps in Zamfara, Sokoto and Katsina states.The two teenagers were abducted when bandits in large numbers invaded Batsari in Katsina State on Wednesday around 12:00am, Daily Trust reports.Naziru and Rabiu escaped when their abductors drank to a stupor.When the two teenagers were led to the bush by their abductors, they were told not to worry as they would be married off as soon as they were brought before the bandits’ kingpin.Upon their arrival, the two girls were provided with bottled juice drinks and loaves of bread while the bandits drank themselves to a stupor.“Upon realising that they were unconscious, we decided to run away. We walked kilometers to a hill and we were lost in the bush,” the teenagers said.The teenagers said they tiptoed out of the bandits’ den and found their way into the bush, even though they did not know where they were heading to.According to them, they met some herders at the foot of a hill and they were directed to the nearby village, Muniya, in Safana Local Government Area, Katsina State.It was at Muniya that they were offered help and taken back home.
