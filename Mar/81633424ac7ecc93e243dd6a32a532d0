APC, in the zoning formula released last week, had ceded the national chairmanship position to the North Central.However, in what appeared like a defiant move to the party's dictate, the former Zamfara governor, Yari, who hails from the North-West region, insisted that he was eligible to contest.Tijani Yahaya Kaura, who picked the form on Yari's behalf after paying N20million said issues around the party's zoning formula remained unsettled."As far as we are concerned there are contending issues concerning zoning. First of all, we are fully aware that the national championship has been zoned to the north and the presidency has been zoned to the South. As you are aware that all positions of the party that were hitherto in the south will go to the north, Zamfara being in the north is well qualified.“We are very ready for the convention come 26th, Yari being one of the founding fathers of this great party and had contributed immensely and greatly to the betterment and welfare of this party. He is ready to lead the party and will not allow it to die."What the party needs now is a unifier. This was a party which was formed by the coming together of many parties. If care is not taken, the party will be so divided but Yari as a founding father will ensure that the party does not disintegrate," Kaura said.
