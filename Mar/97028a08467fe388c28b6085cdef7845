Justice Emeka Nwite of a Federal High Court in Abuja on Monday refused to order the Nigerian government to release the detained Deputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari, from the custody of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA).  Rather, the judge ordered an accelerated trial after agreeing with the prosecutor that Kyari and other defendants are likely to interfere and undermine the trial. SaharaReporters Media The suspended DCP was on March 7, arraigned alongside Sunday J Ubia, Bawa James, Simon Agirigba and John Nuhu who are members of the Police Intelligence Response Team (IRT).  Others are Chibunna Patrick Umeibe and Emeka Alphonsus Ezenwanne, two alleged drug traffickers who were arrested at Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu.  In the charge marked FHC/ABJ/57/2022, the agency accused the defendants of conspiracy, obstruction and dealing in cocaine worth 17.55 kilogrammes.  Mahmoud Magaji, the lawyer who moved Kyari and Ubia’s (second defendant) bail application, prayed the court to grant his clients bail.  Counsel for the third and fifth defendants also prayed for bail on lenient terms.  But Joseph Sunday, prosecution counsel, opposed the bail applications. He said all the conditions for which the defendants should not be granted bail are inherent in the case.
