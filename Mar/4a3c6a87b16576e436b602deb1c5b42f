At least 50 fighters of the Islamic State of the West African Province (ISWAP), have been killed in an ambush by its affiliates, Jama’at Ahl as-Sunnah lid-Da’wah wa’l-Jihad faction of Boko Haram in the North East of Lake Chad, Borno State. The latest battle is part of a renewed war of supremacy between the deadly sects.  The rival groups have been attacking communities in the North-East region since both camps fell apart over leadership issues. The groups have also since been having clashes, and Abubakar Shekau, leader of Boko Haram, was reportedly killed during one of such clashes in 2021. The latest incident sources said, happened when Boko Haram fighters laid an ambush for ISWAP fighters in the Abadam Local Government Area of Borno State. This was said to have led to a gun battle between the two groups. The Boko Haram fighters led by Mohammed Ari were said to have overpowered those of ISWAP, killing about 50 of them. Their bodies were also shown in a trending video as they were being slaughtered and dumped inside makeshift graves around the Lake Chad axis. Some ISWAP insurgents were also burnt inside their gun trucks.
