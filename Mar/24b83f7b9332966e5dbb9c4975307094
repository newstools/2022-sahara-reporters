A human rights activist, Patrick Eholor, has accused billionaire businessman Chief Gabriel Igbinedion of intimidation and forceful conversion of a plot of land belonging to him. Revealing that he had no land deal with Igbinedion but his son-in-law, Osa Osunde, who encroached into his land, Eholor stated that efforts to resolve the issue amicably have been frustrated by the respected Edo chief.  Osunde said the matter was already in court and he would allow it to decide the matter. According to him, he has shown respect to Chief Igbinedion all through the period this matter had persisted but that the former has not made efforts to allow good reason to prevail. Eholor further stated that he had confidence in Nigeria’s justice system to handle the situation well without bias. He said, “Chief Igbinedion decided to intimidate me because he believes he can but I will fight for justice and I am sure I will get it.

8 Months Ago “I did not take Igbinedion to court; he is the one who took me to court. I don’t have any dealings with him; it is his son-in-law, Osa Osunde, who encroached on my land, which I took to court. “I have been with him more than eight times over this matter. I have respected him enough, but it’s time to let the court decide.”
