Nigerian sprinter, Blessing Okagbare, has failed to appeal a 10-year ban slammed on her by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) Disciplinary Tribunal. The 33-year-old received the punishment after the presence and use of multiple prohibited substances was confirmed in her system. Blessing Okagbare

She had threatened to take up her right to appeal against the decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) within 30 days, which elapsed on March 18, 2022. CAS has now confirmed that the former Commonwealth Games double sprint champion did not file any appeal upon enquiry. ”Please be advised that at the time of writing, no appeals have been filed at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in relation to this matter,” CAS Communications Officer, Katy Hogg, said. Okagbare had denied taking prohibited substances by injection or at all. She pointed to her long history of “negative” tests, including 10 of the 12 she underwent between 16 April 2021 and 30 July 2021.
