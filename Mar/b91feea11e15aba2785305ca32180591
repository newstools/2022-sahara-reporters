Ayo Ademiluyi, the lead counsel to the family of Bamise Ayanwole, a lady who went missing after boarding a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) bus in Lagos State, has called on the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, to order the arrest of the Managing Director and CEO of Lagos Bus Services Limited, Idowu Oguntona.Ademiluyi, while addressing newsmen on Friday at the Yaba Magistrate Court also called for the arrest of other co-directors of the company as he noted that the lives of about 30million residents of the city were at stake.He added that the LBSL directors should be arrested for deep questioning by the police to aid in the investigations.He said, "What is at risk is not only Bamise who has gone to the great beyond; what is at risk is about 30 million Lagosians who are still plying the BRT routes. The LBSL has a corporate criminal liability hanging on its neck in this case; we want to call on the Inspector General of Police to move speedily and arrest the managing director of LBSL within the next 24 hours. We cannot entrust the lives, property, our responsibilities into the hands of murderers, killers, people who mutilate the bodies of human beings, we want their arrest as fast as possible."This is with regards to the death of a 22-year-old fashion designer, Bamishe Ayanwole who went missing after she boarded a BRT vehicle from Chevron Bus Stop, Ajah to Oshodi around 7 pm on February 26.On Monday, she was found dead on Carter Bridge, according to the Lagos State Police Command. The driver of the bus, Nice Andrew Omininikoron was arrested in connection with the murder of the young lady.On Friday, he was arraigned before the Yaba Magistrate court after which the police obtained an order for a remand till April 11, 2022, for further investigations, Ademiluyi told the newsmen.He said: "The police came to obtain an order for remand and this is because they have exhausted the time given by the constitution to keep anyone in custody but they need more time to keep him in custody for further investigation and we have called for the arrest of the co-directors of LBSL, those elements need to answer some deep questions."Meanwhile, the lawyer took a swipe at the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu over his refusal, several days after the incident to pay a visit to the bereaved family at their house noting that the governor of the state was a franchisor of the franchise agreement of the BRT declared by the LBSL.He said, "Today attests to the veracity of our method that it is only through resistance that genuine justice can be got for people in this country. Yesterday, we addressed the media that Nigeria Police Force has neglected its duty in arranging the suspect, and thus far, the Nigeria Police Force has now met the constitutional requirement.   "We also want to say that the governor of Lagos State has refused to obey what he swore to by virtue of chapter 2 of the constitution of Nigeria to the effect that he will uphold the security and safety of the people of Lagos state."As we speak, the governor has not paid a condolence visit to the family, there was a rumor regarding the planned visit but there were other matters of the state possibly dancing at Tafawa Balewa Square; this is a huge shame to the LASG. The Lagos state government is the franchisor of the franchise agreement of the BRT which the Lagos Bus services declared."Ademiluyi further warned anyone who might want to doctor the available evidence or put words into the mouth of the prime suspect to desist from such as he assured that justice would prevail in the matter.He said, “If there are forces out there who want to doctor the testimony of Andrew Nice, forces of darkness, evil, unrighteousness, who wants to teach Andrew Nice the nicer statement to speak, there is God in heaven and there are human beings on earth who will match against them.”
