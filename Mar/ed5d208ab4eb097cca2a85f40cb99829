The President of Living Faith Church, also known as Winners Chapel Worldwide, Bishop David Oyedepo has said that anyone who dares to “marry man and man” in his church will not make heaven. The cleric, who frowned at gay marriage, said God created men and women to replenish the earth.  Speaking during a programme at the Church’s headquarters on Monday, Oyedepo stressed that no government policy under heaven could rule over his faith. ”Don’t say I believe the whole Bible. Specifically what are the fundamental things you believe? Do you believe in the second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ? Do you believe in the second coming? You believe in rapture? You believe in marriage between man and woman? Not between female and female, man and man? ”Till Jesus comes, anyone who dares to marry man and man in this church will not make heaven. No policy of any government under heaven can rule over my faith. What I believe I believe. ”It is not your policy that brought me to what I believe. People fall too cheaply to things. We are defenders of the gospel. Male and female he created he them. Reason, to replenish the earth.”
