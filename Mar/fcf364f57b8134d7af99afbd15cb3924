Nigerian music star, Inetimi Timaya Odon, better known by his stage name Timaya, has been arrested for allegedly leaving a lady hospitalised in a hit-and-run accident. On Wednesday, March 2, 2022, an Instagram user Osinubi Omowumi, who claimed to be the sister of the victim, accused the music star of ramming his car into her sister after she challenged him for damaging her car.  The lady alleged that Timaya hit her sister’s car and when the sister got down to confront him, he hit her with his car and drove off. She went on to share screenshots of her messages to Timaya on Instagram following the incident and added that Timaya blocked her on IG when she confronted him about hitting her sister. Timaya didn’t acknowledge the allegation, instead, he continued tweeting like nothing happened and this angered many Nigerians. A video seen by SaharaReporters shows men of the Nigeria Police Force at the residence of the music star on Thursday morning. In the video, he was seen explaining to the officers what transpired during the alleged hit and run incident. A few minutes later, he was whisked away by the armed police officers. Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Adekunle Ajisebutu confirmed the arrest. “He is being investigated for a case of a serious motor accident. Further details later,” he said.
