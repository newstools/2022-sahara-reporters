A former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Lasun Yusuf, on Friday dumped the All Progressives Congress (APC). Lasun, a former governorship aspirant of the APC in 2018 tendered his resignation letter on Friday at the APC Secretariat in Osogbo, the Osun State capital.  Lasun came third behind Moshood Adeoti and the eventual winner and Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola in the recently held primary election to choose the APC candidate for the next governorship election in the state. Lasun had in December 2021 declared that nobody “born of a woman” could stop him from contesting the 2022 governorship election in the state. The former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives had also alleged that the APC did not win the 2018 governorship election which brought Adegboyega Oyetola into office. “Nobody born of a woman can do to me what they did to me in 2018. My party, the APC did not win the Osun State governorship election,” Lasun had said.
