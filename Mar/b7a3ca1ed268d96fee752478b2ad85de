President Muhammadu Buhari, on Sunday, said Vice President Yemi Osinbajo is in charge of the country.This comes the President departs the country to the United Kingdom for a medical checkup. His departure had earlier been announced by the Special Adviser to the President, Femi Adesina.It is, however, not clear if Buhari already transmitted a letter to the National Assembly handing over power to Osinbajo pending his return to the country.Buhari had said, “Well, I cannot claim to be doing the work alone. The government is fully represented. The Vice President is there.“Constitutionally, when I’m away, he’s in charge. Then, we have the Secretary to the Government of the Federation and then the Chief of Staff, so, there’s no problem.”Since he assumed office on May 29, 2015, Buhari has embarked on medical trips abroad several times, covering a period of no fewer than 200 days of the six years he has been in power.
