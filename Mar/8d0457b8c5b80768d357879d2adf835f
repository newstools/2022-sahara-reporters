The Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) has created the Office of Directorate of Politics and Governance ahead of the 2023 general elections in Nigeria.In a memo addressed to all regions, provinces, zones and other levels of the church, the church led by Pastor Enoch Adeboye stated that the newly-created directorate is to coordinate the affairs and activities of members interested in seeking political offices in 2023.The memo with reference number RCCG/AGO/ADM/AA.MEMO/20/01/2022 was dated February 28 and signed by the Assistant General Overseer (Admin/Personnel) Pastor J. F. Odesola.The directorate, it was learnt, would also prod members of the church to obtain their Permanent Voter Cards ahead of the 2023 general elections.The church also announced the appointment of Pastor Timothy Olaniyan, a pastor in charge of Province (PICP) Lagos Province 12 as the head of the directorate.“We write to formally notify you that the mission authority has created the Office of Directorate of Politics and Governance in the RCCG. Further to this, Pastor Timothy Olaniyan (PICP Lagos Province 12) has been appointed to lead the office,” the memo read.“You are kindly requested to appoint with immediate effect a Provincial Officer for your province and also ensure that the same is done at all levels of the church – zone, area and parish.“The essence of this directorate is to help coordinate the engagement of our people who are willing to be involved in politics as well as mobilise support for them when required.”RCCG, therefore, asked that its parishes send the details of its nominated coordinators for the office to Odesola within two weeks of receipt of the letter.Nigeria’s Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo is a member and pastor of the church.Although Osinbajo has not declared his interest in the 2023 presidential race, different groups have been soliciting Nigerians’ support for the vice-president.In January, a group called the Concerned Citizens of Nigeria launched an online petition urging Nigerians to persuade him to contest the presidency in 2023.Attachments area
