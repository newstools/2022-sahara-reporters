NAN quoted him as saying, “Twelve members of our community were taken away by the hoodlums who also burgled six houses within the area. “An 80-year-old woman was beaten to stupor and some of her belongings were stolen by the gang." The victim, 80-year-old Comfort Fagboun, said the hoodlums forcibly broke the entrance door to her apartment, beat her up and carted away money and some other items in her room. She appealed to the state government to help the community fish out the culprits and bring them to justice. Rukayat Tajudeen, also a resident, said her husband was beaten and kidnapped by the hoodlums. “We urge the government to intervene in our situation and rescue the community members from the hands of the hoodlums,” she added. Rasheed Olaleye, the Alakoso of Araromi Orita Community, also appealed to the government to intervene and stop the incessant invasion of the village by hoodlums.
