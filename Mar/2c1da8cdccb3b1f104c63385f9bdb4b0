As crisis continues to trail the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) over its national convention, the party must be cautious not to further take steps that will jeopardise its electoral chances in the 2023 general elections, a chieftain of the party, Ralph Ude told SaharaReporters.The simmering leadership crisis rocking the party had taken a different dimension on Monday when the Governor of Niger State, Abubakar Bello, stormed the party’s national secretariat to assume Chairmanship of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee.Bello, who arrived amid heightened security presence comprising about 70 security personnel with no less than 15 patrol vehicles, which barricaded access roads to the premises, said he had the blessing of the President Muhammadu Buhari.Speaking also on Channels Television’s Politics Today, Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State said Governor Mai Mala Buni, who is currently out of the country, could only return as governor of Yobe State, but not as chairman of the ruling party.However, the APC Senate Caucus, on Wednesday in an emergency meeting insisted that Buni was the CECPC chairman.Senators at the meeting included Senate President Ahmad Lawan, his deputy, Ovie Omo-Agege, the Chief Whip, Orji Uzor Kalu and other principal officers.“These are trying times for major political parties in the country, the very reason we in the APC as Senate caucus met for the second day running this week towards required collaboration with other stakeholders for unity of purpose in the party ahead of the coming National Convention and 2023 general elections,” the lawmakers said.“Required strategies have been mapped out by the caucus to bring all interests groups together in making the party stronger and well positioned for the 2023 general elections.“The reported storm in the party by the media is not true as there was no leadership crisis. Governor Buni to us, remains the Chairman of National Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the Party.“He will resume in that capacity any moment he returns from Dubai where he went for medical check.”Also a Bwari division of the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory in suit number FCT/HC/CV/2958/2021 had restrained the ruling party from holding its convention until a substantive suit had been heard and determined.The suit, filed by one Salisu Umoru at the court had the APC, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and Buni as respondents.“That the 1st Defendant/Respondent can only conduct its national convention after the hearing and determination of the substantive suit pending before this honourable court,” the court order seen by SaharaReporters reads.“That in the interest of justice accelerated hearing of the substantive suit is hereby ordered.“That this matter is hereby adjourned to the 10th day of January 2022 for hearing of the substantive suit at High Court No. 15, Kubwa, FCT-Abuja.”Speaking to SaharaReporters, Ude said holding the convention on March 26 would worsen the deteriorating internal affairs of the party and lead to several court cases against it.The APC chieftain said, “The insistence of the current acting chairman of the party’s CECPC, Alhaji Abu Bello to unconstitutionally coronate himself as the substantive Chairman and go ahead and hold the party’s National Convention on March 26 without first performing the constitutional requirements that will enable a valid convention is akin to leading the party to self-destruct.“Section 82 (1) of the Electoral Act 2022, provides that: Every registered political party shall give the Commission at least 21 days’ notice of any convention, congress, conference or meeting convened for the purpose of “merger” and electing members of its executive committees, other governing bodies or nominating candidates for any of the elective offices specified under this Act.“It is clear that the APC is yet to transmit such letter to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), in conformity with the above provision. Today is 10th of March 2022, a 21days notice for an event slated for the 26th of March should have come latest 5th of March.“This glaring failure to adhere to the above provisions makes the March 26th convention date impracticable, and any insistence to continue with the convention plans will be an exercise in futility, an incurable illegality that cannot stand.“Secondly, continuing with the preparation ahead of the March 26th convention, without first vacating an interlocutory court order, restraining the party from organizing the convention, will only worsen the deteriorating internal affairs of the party and invalidate the National convention.“In the interest of the APC, the 26th March 2022 National convention, which is untenable given the legal impediments, must be jettisoned and a new date set to enable the party organize a National convention that is within our legal frameworks.“Insistence on the March 26th date is unwittingly leading the party to the electoral gallows in 2023 as the election of every future candidate of the party, that is a product of a primary election, organised by the products of an improperly organised convention, stands the high risk of being disqualified and the party with the second highest number of votes installed in all the positions. APC might cease to exist. This is like handing back power at the Centre to the PDP on a platter.“Therefore, it is imperative that the APC postpones the March 26th national convention, and work hard to fix a new date that will allow the party organize a national convention without fears of incurring the wraths of our laws.”
