Human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore, has told the Nigerian police that he is ready to remain in detention and the police can keep him as long as they want.Sowore had on Monday morning made himself available to the police when he walked to the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) notoriously known as Abattoir located in Guzape. Upon his arrival at the facility, he had been violently attacked and assaulted alongside his lawyers by the police attached to the main gate of the Inspector-General of Police Intelligence Response Team (IRT).Recall that the police had on Friday, March 4, arrested Sowore’s lawyer, Abubakar Marshal, in his home on a trumped up allegation that he stood as surety for the activist.He was hurriedly arraigned before an Area Court in Kabusa after which a judge was hired by Ned Nwoko to do a hatchet job.The lawyer was later remanded at Kuje prison before he was moved to Keffi prison.The Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) had condemned and described the incarceration of the lawyer as a manifestation of gross impunity and conspicuous disdain for the rule of law and the process of law.According to Sowore’s lawyer, Pelumi Olajengbesi, the police presented to Sowore the trumped up charge preferred against him which bordered on criminal defamation of a so-called billionaire, Ned Nwoko.Pelumi said no surety was ready to come forward fear of being victimised and attacked by the police.He added that the activist had vowed to remain with the police as long as they could keep him or take him to court.He said Sowore had been restricted to Abuja and his International Passport had been deposited with the Federal High Court.He said the police in connivance with Nwoko were just out to frustrate the activist knowingly because he was currently on city arrest.The lawyer also expressed displeasure over the degrading treatments meted out to some activists who were arrested for accompanying Sowore to the police station.He said, “They were asked to lie on the floor like a common criminals. We were not allowed to talk or interact with them. We let them realise that these were activists but not criminals.“This is what we call torture in law.”In a statement issued on Sunday in Abuja by the Chairman, Security Agencies Relations Committee, Chief Joe-Kyari Gadzama SAN, the association called for Marshal’s immediate release.
