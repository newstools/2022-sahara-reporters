The Acting Force Public Relations Officer (FPRO), CSP Olumuyiwa Adejobi has disclosed the identity of a police officer who illegally arrested a man for not having a tinted glass permit. A viral video had shown the police officer demanding a fine from a driver for having tinted glass without a permit.  This came a few hours after the Nigeria Police Force (NPF), ordered personnel across the country and in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja to stop demanding customs papers and tinted glass permits from drivers. Adejobi on Sunday, posted on Twitter, “No policeman should demand your customs papers. except they are on joint operation, but not just on mere routine checks “We have suspended the issuance of tinted glass permits, so we don’t expect our men to disturb Nigerians on this. “We are to stop any vehicle with tints, search the vehicle, and its occupants, but not to delay him for not having tinted glass permits. Report them if you are so delayed so that we ask them (the personnel) questions.” But a video surfaced on Wednesday showing an officer demanding a fine from a driver because of his tinted glass. In the video, the police officer called the driver a ‘suspect’ for not having a tinted permit. The driver who took to his Twitter account to post the video and share his experience further claimed that the police officer demanded N20,000 from him. Reacting in a tweet, Adejobi announced that the police officer had been identified. He further noted that the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Abiodun Alabi, had taken over the matter. “My people, this policeman has been identified as Insp Dele Ruben, attached to Area F, Ikeja, Lagos State. The Commissioner of Police Lagos State has taken over the matter for necessary action. I believe in his action and judgment on the matter. Let’s wait for the feedback. Thanks,” his tweet reads.
