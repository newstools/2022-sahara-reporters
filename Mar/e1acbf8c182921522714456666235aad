Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto State has urged the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to concentrate on how to win the election, rather than zoning of offices.Tambuwal affirmed that the Southern region may not be able to win the 2023 election for the party. The former Speaker made this known while speaking, on Tuesday, during a consultative meeting with former principal officers of the National Assembly in Abuja.Tambuwal who said that “you cannot zone what you don’t have” advised the leadership of the PDP and other stakeholders to first win the election before zoning it.He gave an analogy of recent elections to show why it might be difficult for the Southern region to win the presidency for the PDP based on votes cast."The party should be strategic. All Progressives Congress (APC) took their presidential candidate to Katsina State in 2015 even when the late President Umaru Musa Yar’adua who was in office was also from Katsina," he said.
