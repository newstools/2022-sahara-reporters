No fewer than 26 people have reportedly been killed and many others injured by suspected armed herders at Tor-Damisa community in the Donga Local Government Area of Taraba State.It was learnt that the people killed in the attack included children and women. According to Punch, the attack, which happened in the early hours of Monday, has left hundreds of houses burnt while properties worth millions of naira were also destroyed.The attack was said to be a reprisal attack after a Fulani man in the area was allegedly shot in the leg by a suspected Tiv farmer, who is currently receiving treatment and in police custody.The village head of the community, Zaki Ugondo Uma, who said that more bodies were still being recovered, explained that there was a little misunderstanding between Fulani herders and some Tiv farmers in the community and that he made frantic efforts with the Fulani leaders to restore normalcy.He said, “Some farmers had an issue with Fulani herders, but we reached a truce and they assured us of peace. I am taken aback as we woke up this morning to witness a massive attack on our community affecting over 15 villages.“As I am talking, we are yet to recover all bodies, but more than 26 corpses have been recovered. We are in a situation of despair as we don’t know if the attack will continue.“I am calling on the state to provide security and as well intervene with relied materials for thousands that have been rendered homeless,” Uma added.Confirming the incident, the Police Public Relations Officer, Taraba State Command, ASP Usman Abubakar, noted that the command was aware of the incident but was yet to ascertain the cause of the crisis and the number of casualties.
