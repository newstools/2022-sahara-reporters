Irate constituents on Sunday pelted a lawmaker in the Niger State House of Assembly with stones.They also chased him and his entourage away after arriving in a convoy during his visit to the area, SaharaReporters learnt. They accused the lawmaker of not visiting the community despite its security challenges until now that political campaigns for the 2023 elections are about to start.  SaharaReporters learnt that the legislator had gone back home to his Magama constituency in the Niger State House of Assembly to commiserate with the community over recent banditry attacks that claimed many lives. Angry youths reportedly went wild and attacked him with stones, saying, "We don't want your so-called sympathy visit, because you have neglected us all this while." The lawmaker was accused of abandoning his people since he was elected. "Despite several attacks on our communities, he never came to sympathise with us until another round of politicking is about to start," a constituent told SaharaReporters.
