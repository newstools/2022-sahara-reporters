The victim, who was identified as Alamin Isa Ali Pantami, lives with his grandmother.Confirming his release, one of the victim’s guardians, said, “We just left the house; he is back home now. He was found in Dambam, where his abductors dropped him. They dropped him at a checkpoint and from there, he was brought home.”The menace of kidnapping has been a source of concern to Nigerians, who have repeatedly called on the government to address the trend.The last known case of the son of a serving minister happened in 2019 when Dayo Adewole, son of the then Minister of Health, Isaac Adewole, was abducted.Adewole, who was kidnapped at his farm located at Iroko near Fiditi in Afijio Local Government Area of Oyo State, was released after 24 hours.Last year, Dapit Karen, a niece to the Minister of Women Affairs, Pauline Talen, was kidnapped at Rantiya Lowcost in Jos South Local Government Area of Plateau State, but she regained freedom after 48 hours.
