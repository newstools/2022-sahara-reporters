The Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Awwal Gambo, has warned retiring soldiers of the Nigerian Armed Forces to be wary of subversive elements within the society, urging them to stay away from such and remain loyal to the Nigerian military.Admiral Gambo spoke at the passing out of 329 military personnel from the Nigerian Armed Forces Resettlement Centre in Lagos, urging the soldiers to also remain loyal to the Federal Republic of Nigeria, especially as the insecurity within the country had taken a new dimension. Gambo was special guest of honour during the passing out ceremony of the NAFRC Course 1/2022 Stream one, where 258 Nigerian Army personnel, 59 Nigerian Navy and 12 Nigerian Air Force graduated from the course.He said, “So many challenges are associated with post service life which include how you manage your resources especially your retirement benefits among others.“Also, influence from members of your family and friends, management of your physical and mental health as well as integrating with the civil society must be properly managed.“Therefore, I urge you to be proactive in your conduct in order to overcome these challenges because your loyalty to the Armed Forces of Nigeria and the Federal Republic is non- negotiable.”Gambo said that it was also risky for them to embark on a new lifestyle that was above their means or engage in non-lucrative ventures, neither should they abstain from physical exercises.“The society will expect high moral standards and discipline from you and you will have to prove that you passed through a highly disciplined system.“I am sure that your training exposed you to several vocational opportunities and general management skills to alleviate above mentioned pitfalls inorder to have a stress-free and meaningful life in retirement,” he said.
