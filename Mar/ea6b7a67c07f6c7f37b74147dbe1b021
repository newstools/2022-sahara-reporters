Embattled Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi, has met with the National leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Tinubu in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.The Special Assistant to the Governor of Ebonyi State, Francis Nwaze, made the disclosure via a post on his official Facebook page on Friday.“Presidential hopeful and Governor of Ebonyi State, Engr. David Umahi, FNSE, FNATE meets Alh. Bola Ahmed Tinubu in Abuja on Friday, March 11, 2022,” he wrote.The post, however, failed to reveal details of the meeting but may not be unconnected to the sacking of the governor by a Federal High Court in Abuja and the current crisis rocking the party.Governor Umahi of Ebonyi State and his deputy, Dr Eric Igwe and 17 lawmakers had approached the Abuja division of the Court of Appeal for the interpretation of some constitutional issues arising from the suit filed by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) challenging their defection to the APC.A Federal High Court, Abuja had on Tuesday sacked the governor and his deputy over their defection from the PDP to the APC.The court also ordered 17 lawmakers from Ebonyi to vacate their seats.But in the notice of appeal filed at the Court of Appeal, Abuja Division, the Umahi and others said the lower court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the matter ab initio.They requested the appellate court to restore the powers of state High courts as the only courts vested with the exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine the question as to whether the term of office of a member of the House of Assembly of a State, a Governor or Deputy Governor had ceased or become vacant.
