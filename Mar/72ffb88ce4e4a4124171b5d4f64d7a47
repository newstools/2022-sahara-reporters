Pro-Biafra group, the Biafra Nations League (BNL) has directed its fighters to mount roadblocks on major roads in the South East on April 8.  The group said it gave the order following the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) leader, Nnamdi Kanu’s court proceedings coming up on the particular date.  BNL, like IPOB is seeking to break the South-East away from Nigeria to form an independent country called Biafra.  A statement issued by its leader, Princewill C Richards also directed members to block all border entrances.  A statement released by the separatist group on Wednesday said, “The leader of the Biafra Nations League, BnL, Princewill C Richards has directed its members to mount roadblocks, block border entrances in solidarity with Nnamdi Kanu's court case coming up on April 8.  “The BnL leader also called on all militias loyal to the group in the Bakassi Peninsula to ensure that any oil worker who has been defying the group’s order to shut down operations is apprehended on the said day. “Richards said BnL will continue to threaten oil companies in the region unless they come to an agreement which must include stopping the 60% Nigeria derives from the oil in the Eastern end of the Gulf of Guinea; the BnL leader gave this directive today during a meeting with Ejagham supporters of the group in Ekukunela, Ikom LGA of Cross River State.  “He said arrangements are on the ground to ensure that they're able to outsmart both Nigeria and Cameroonian security operatives to secure oil companies at maritime borders. Recall that a few weeks ago, an attempt was reportedly made to apprehend two French oil workers in Bakassi by a militant group suspected to be BnL members. The group has vowed that is not to resume hostilities in the Peninsula.”
