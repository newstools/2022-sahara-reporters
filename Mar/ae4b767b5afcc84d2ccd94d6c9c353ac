Two suspected pickpockets say they make as much as N80,000 daily from the crime. The suspects, Sodiq Olagoke (25) and Lucas Patrick (26), were arrested by the Lagos State Task Force on Tuesday after stealing mobile phones from commuters around Oshodi/Ikeja Along.  Trained as a painter, Olagoke said he later veered into an illegal line of picking pockets for a living, PM News reports. According to him, he makes as much as N80,000 daily, which he shares with his partner. He said, “We operate mainly on Tuesdays and Fridays because those are the busiest days of the week and there is usually a lot of hustle and bustle at the bus stops. “Passengers who make use of their phones while in our bus are usually falsely alerted by the conductor that there is a fight going on in front which would make the passenger pocket the phone then we steal it.” Patrick, who drives while his partner steals from passengers, also said he makes good money as a pickpocket. “We make a lot of money from it but unfortunately we spend our proceeds on drinks, women and gambling. “I was originally a driver of a Danfo bus but when I came across Sodiq one day when he operated successfully in my bus, I decided to go into partnership with him. I drive him around while he steals phones from the passengers,” he said. Lagos State Task Force Chairman, CSP Shola Jejeloye, however, vowed that the Agency would make the state uninhabitable for criminal elements. “We kept on their trail for a few minutes before double-crossing their vehicle at Oshodi, leading to all three occupants taking to their heels,” he said, narrating how the duo was caught. He said the two suspects were arrested with the assistance of passersby, adding that eight mobile phones were found on them.
