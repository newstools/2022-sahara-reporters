A yet-to-be-identified dispatched rider has been arrested in Sangotedo area of Lagos State with a baby inside his courier box. The development was posted on Twitter alongside a video by Gidi Traffic in the early hours of Saturday.  The baby was reportedly rescued by a group of people who reportedly heard his cry while in traffic congestion. One of the persons in the background was heard saying, “This is the child that was abducted.” The development comes amid the outrage over the murder of a 22-year-old fashion designer, who went missing after boarding a BRT in the area, last week.
