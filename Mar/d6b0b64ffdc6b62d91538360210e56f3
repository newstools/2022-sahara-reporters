Several bigwigs in the ruling All Progressives Congress party are currently worried as it appears that most of its key national positions will be taken by politicians who had defected from the opposition Peoples Democratic Party.SaharaReporters learnt that there are worries for APC top shots that former PDP chieftains are coming to control and take over the ruling party which could lead to its being ousted from power in 2023. Top sources within the party mentioned more than five key names being considered for national leadership positions in the party ahead of the March 26 national convention who are former chieftains of the PDP.Already the crisis rocking the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led caretaker committee has yet to die off completely, as the committee appears to have lost the trust and confidence of most APC bigwigs nationally.Speaking with SaharaReporters on Friday, one of the top sources said, “How APC National Convention is turning out is that the party is considering Adamu Abdullahi for chairman. But there are worries that former PDP people will control our party.“Adamu Abdullahi joined the APC from PDP. Also, Yakubu Dogara is PDP. The Iyiola Omisore (a former Deputy Governor of Osun State) being considered for National Secretary is PDP; even Kenneth Nnamani to contest from the South-East is also PDP.”"Nnamani is to represent the South-East and was even the Senate President on the platform of the PDP. This is the reason why they want to drop Omisore and replace him with Ife Oyedele, who was with the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC)."Oyedele is an electrical engineer and political associate of President Muhammadu Buhari. During the week, SaharaReporters reported how embattled Governor Buni and chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) caretaker committee, on Thursday, returned to Nigeria following a medical trip abroad.Buni had reportedly taken control of the party, according to a statement by Mamman Mohammed, the governor's director general of press and media relations.According to the statement, the Yobe governor had asked APC members to support the party ahead of its March 26 national convention, while urging them to shun issues capable of hindering the party from success.“Put the recent events in the party behind you and work towards a successful convention,” Buni was quoted as saying.“The success of the party remains paramount and needs the support of every member. As we head towards the national convention, the party needs the support of every stakeholder and member to succeed,” he had said.The APC leadership crisis started in late February when Niger State Governor Abubakar Sani Bello took over the affairs of the party. Later, a letter surfaced that Mai Mala had delegated him because he had travelled abroad for a medical check-up.However, some governors, including Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna, afterwards said it was President Muhammadu Buhari who ordered the removal of Mai Mala Buni, who took office in June 2020.The move comes as the party plans to hold its national convention on March 26, where leaders would be elected at the national level despite a court order to adjourn.But on Friday, an FCT High Court issued an order vacating the restraining injunction against the March 26 convention of the APC.The APC had slated March 26 for its national convention where it would elect leaders into key national offices of the party.However, shortly after necessary committees for the convention were set up, an order restraining the party from going ahead with the planned convention had surfaced.The restraining order was issued on November 18, 2021, by Justice Bello Kawu of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court.The suit, filed by one Salisu Umoru at the court had the APC, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and Buni as respondents.However, Justice Kawu on Friday held that a member of a political party could not sue the party.He said the order of November 18, 2021, had been overtaken by a recent Supreme Court judgment on a similar matter.The court fixed March 30 for the substantive suit.
