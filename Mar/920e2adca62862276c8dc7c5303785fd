President Vladimir Putin of Russia has written to Nana Akufo-Addo of Ghana congratulating the latter on the 65th independence anniversary of the West African country.This is even as the country marks its anniversary on Sunday upon attaining independence from her British colonial masters 65 years ago.





The national event is being held at the Cape Coast Sports stadium in the Central Region for the first time.Putin wrote Akufo-Addo amid Russia's ongoing military offensive against Ukraine. He wrote, “Please accept my sincere congratulations on the occasion of the National Holiday of the Republic of Ghana - the Independence Day!“The relations between Russia and Ghana are traditionally of a friendly nature. I am convinced that further development of a constructive bilateral dialogue and partnership meets the interests of our peoples, contributing to the peace and security on the African continent.“I wish you good health and every success, as well as happiness and prosperity to all your compatriots.”Meanwhile, Ghana was among other African countries which cast a historic vote to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine at the UN Security Council.Albania and the United States submitted a draft to the UN Security Council to end Russia’s military aggression on Ukraine. The Council had drafted a resolution for cessation of force by the Russian forces, withdrawal of troops from the Ukrainian territory. The draft also directed the reversal of the recognition of Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions.However, the Russian Federation, refusing to be boxed into a corner by the council, vetoed the draft which had already garnered the support of 11 nations with the abstention of China, India and the United Arab Emirates who refused to vote.Ghana, Kenya and Gabon who are among the 15- member UN security council all voted in favour of the draft which would have recognised Russia’s invasion as violating Article 2, paragraph 4 of the Charter of the United Nations, had Russia not wielded its veto power.
