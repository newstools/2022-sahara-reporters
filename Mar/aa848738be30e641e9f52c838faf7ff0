The Nigerian government has said repairs on the damaged portion of the Abuja-Kaduna rail line recently damaged by terrorists will commence immediately. The Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, who disclosed this in Kaduna on Wednesday during a visit to victims of the attack on a Kaduna-bound train by terrorists, added that the government was considering recruiting locals to provide security around areas where terrorists operate along the rail. Amaechi said following the directive by President Muhammadu Buhari to fix the rail for train operations to resume, the ministry has set modalities in place to commence work immediately. He said the office of the National Security Adviser will be consulted to ensure that only people of integrity are recruited for the job. The hospitals he visited include the Nigerian Army Reference Hospital, Kaduna where 25 victims were said to have been admitted. According to the chief medical officer of the hospital, out of the total number admitted, only seven people were left as others had been discharged. At the St. Gerrard’s Catholic Hospital, eleven victims were admitted, out of which ten have been discharged, and one female currently receiving treatment. One victim was said to have been brought dead according to the hospital management.
