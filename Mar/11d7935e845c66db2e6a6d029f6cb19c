The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has launched a formal review into Will Smith's slap of Chris Rock at the Oscars and says it condemns the action.As a result, Smith risks losing the award he won over the weekend following the assault on Rock. 





However, Los Angeles' rich and famous still welcomed Smith like a hero as they partied with him on Sunday night, a report by Daily Mail said. Smith, 53, was hugged, high-fived and hallowed by guests at the Vanity Fair party in Beverley Hills even after he assaulted the comedian just minutes before being handed his now-tainted Best Actor award.Despite being accused of shaming his profession and wrecking a historic moment when he became just the fifth black man to win an Oscar for male lead, he was mobbed by A-listers desperate to celebrate with him.Critics have also pointed out that Kevin Hart was banned as host of the 2019 Academy Awards over historic unacceptable tweets -- but has not punished Smith for punching someone.
