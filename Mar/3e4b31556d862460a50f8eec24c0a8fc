Many commuters around the Ikotun, Idimu and Igando axes were stranded on Tuesday following a riot by members of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW).SaharaReporters gathered that commercial bus drivers were stopped from operating from Ikotun to Isheri and also from Isheri to Igando axis. Several sources claimed the riot was against the incessant arrest of NURTW members and extortion by operatives of the Lagos State Task Force. A young lady identified simply as Bisola said, “I stay in Ijegun but I work at Idimu. This morning when I left my house, I had no idea I was going to trek to my workplace. I got a vehicle from Ijegun to Ikotun but from Ikotun, no vehicles were going to Idimu so I joined others who were already trekking. Many people were stranded. “When I got to Arida Bus Stop, a bus stopped by to pick up passengers going to Isheri, we trooped in though the fare was hiked. But before we got to Nobex bus stop, the NURTW guys stopped the vehicle and forced all of us to alight. Though the driver didn't get to my destination, at least he helped me get to my workplace in time.”Another commuter who resides in Isheri said he was about to leave for his work station at Igando when he learnt of the riot and had to order a ride on the Bolt app.He said, “I woke up quite early because I had some uncompleted tasks from yesterday so I already did those and planned to get to the office on time today. “When I got to Isheri bus stop, I just observed that everywhere was dry, there were no buses anywhere and you know motorcycles have been banned from plying this route so I was confused. “I asked a few people around what the problem was and when I learnt that NURTW guys were the ones responsible for it, I just had to order a ride on one of these cab-hailing services.”
