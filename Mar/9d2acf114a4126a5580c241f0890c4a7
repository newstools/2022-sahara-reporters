A video journalist for Fox News was killed in Ukraine when the vehicle he was travelling in outside of Kyiv with another reporter came under fire, the network said on Tuesday. The slain videographer, Pierre Zakrzewski, 55, had covered conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria for Fox, the network said in a memo to staff. 





“His passion and talent as a journalist were unmatched,” Suzanne Scott, CEO of Fox News Media, said in the memo. Reporter Benjamin Hall has been hospitalised since Monday when their vehicle was hit in Horenka, the network said. Zakrzewski, who was based in London, was the second journalist killed in Ukraine in two days. Brent Renaud, a documentary filmmaker and another veteran of covering war zones, died Sunday after Russian forces opened fire on his vehicle.Scott said of Zakrzewski: “His talents were vast and there wasn’t a role that he didn’t jump in to help with in the field — from photographer to engineer to editor to producer — and he did it all under immense pressure with tremendous skill.”
