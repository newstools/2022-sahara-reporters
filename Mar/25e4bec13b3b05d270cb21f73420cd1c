The Muslim Rights Concern has called on the national leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party to call its Taraba State chapter to order.This followed a comment by the party accusing the Islamic organisation of trying to cause religious conflict in the state. But in its response on Friday, MURIC said the issue was not politics insisting that it was a case of religious cleansing of Muslims in appointments.A statement by MURIC’s Director, Prof Ishaq Akintola, alleged that Governor Darius Ishaku has been marginalising Muslims in Taraba.Akintola said MURIC’s grudge against Ishaku has to do “with the way he has been trampling with impunity on Allah-given fundamental human rights” of Islam faithful.He called for good governance and responsible leadership that will ensure justice, equity and fairness to all irrespective of ethnicity or faith.“Governor Ishaku is taking his party’s state chapter to a dangerous arena by using the party to fight Muslims. It is not done.“Muslims are in the PDP in their millions. So they are in other political parties. It will not be so wise for the PDP to antagonise all Muslims in the party,” the statement party stated.The Muslim group further said the victimisation of Islam adherents “deeply hurts Taraba Muslims”.The body added that the “denial of jobs to Muslims is aimed at impoverishing them”.The statement condemned the alleged “religious cleansing whereby Muslims are sacked and replaced by Christians”.Akintola urged the PDP headquarters to investigate its allegations, accusing Ishaku of “trying to cover up his crimes by whipping up political sentiment”.
