The African Action Congress in Edo has slammed the state governor, Godwin Obaseki, for announcing a date for local council elections less than 20 days to the time rather than the 90 days stipulated by law.  In a statement on Friday by the chairman of the party in the state, Com. J.C. Hafiz Lawal, the AAC accused Obaseki of manipulating the electoral process to favour him and his political associates.  The statement reads, "Yesterday, the African Action Congress was notified of the news that Edo council elections were slated for April 19, 2022.  "This is less than 20 days away. This is condemnable and portrays dictatorial qualities.  "The late notice of Edo council elections by Edo State Government shows how incompetent and unfit the governor of Edo State and his group of political travellers are.  "Why is the governor afraid to give 90 days’ notice instead of this personal motive-prone move? This is laughable.  "Let me use this medium to recommend that the government of Obaseki should eat its vomits and call ESIEC (Edo State Independent Electoral Commission) to order to immediately amend the timetable for the LGA elections."
