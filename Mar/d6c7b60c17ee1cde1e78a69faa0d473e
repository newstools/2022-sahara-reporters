The Speaker of the Cross River State House of Assembly, Eteng Williams, says he is not aware of any judgment sacking him or any other member of the assembly.A Federal High Court in Abuja had on Monday, sacked Williams and 19 of his colleagues over their defection from the Peoples Democratic Party to the All Progressives Congress (APC). The affected members include 18 House of Assembly members and two House of Representatives members making them 20 in number.The judge, Taiwo Taiwo, while delivering judgement on a suit instituted by the PDP to challenge the lawmakers’ defection, dismissed all the preliminary objections raised by the sacked lawmakers.“A day must surely come when elected officials, must ask the people who voted for them before defecting to other political parties,” Taiwo said.He noted that “lawmakers wined and dined under the umbrella of the PDP,” but ditched the party even when there was no justification for their action.“The defendants’ court documents were contrived and filed with loopholes. The papers are manifestly defective,” the judge said while granting all the reliefs sought by the PDP.The defendants in the suit were the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the APC and clerk of the State House of Assembly.Reaction to the judgement, the sacked Speaker said, “As far as I’m concerned and as far as I know, I am not aware of any court judgement sacking me or any member of the CRSHA, because we have not been served any order as we speak.”The latest judgement comes two weeks after Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court in Abuja sacked Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State, his deputy, Kelechi Igwe, along with 15 lawmakers in the state House of Assembly.
