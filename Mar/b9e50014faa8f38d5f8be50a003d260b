The Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide has urged the Peoples Democratic Party presidential candidate in the 2019 elections, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, not to contest for President in 2023 to pave the way for the emergence of a candidate from the South-East.The President-General of the group, Igboayaka O. Igboayaka in a statement on Monday urged Atiku to show maturity by ignoring any call to contest so as to uphold the unity of the Nigerian nation. He frowned on what he described as "the undue desperation of Atiku Abubakar to pick the presidential ticket of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).”Reacting to the meeting of Atiku Abubakar with the PDP Board of Trustees (BoT) on Tuesday, March 15, 2022, over his presidential ambition, Igboayaka described it as a call that would instigate Nigeria's disintegration.He quoted Atiku Abubakar to have said "that PDP can't afford to lose 2023 Presidency", insisting that the latter ought to know that "if PDP dares give him a ticket in 2023 against Southeast aspirants, the party will not just lose the election, but it will be an evidential call for total disintegration of Nigeria."Atiku Abubakar should go to the history line of PDP formation from G34 led by Dr. Alex Ekwueme before it became a political party, to ascertain that Southeast has paid the ultimate sacrifice in PDP more than any other zone in Nigeria.”Speaking further, he reiterated thatSoutheastern people have contributed a lot in sustaining the PDP as a big party in Africa."Atiku Abubakar's call to contest in PDP is a call to interrupt the Unity and Peace in Nigeria and such move will lead to National political disaster, anarchy and tribal crises that will sink Nigeria,” Igboayaka said."If PDP denies a Southeasterner Presidential ticket, the only thing over 50 million Igbo youths must ensure is to keep Nigeria one by massively voting APC Presidential candidate from Southeast, and no PDP office/flag from ward level to state level will stand erect in Southeast. We'll fight PDP like Yakubu Gowon did to keep Nigeria one."PDP must avoid using Atiku Abubakar, Aminu Tambuwal and other selfish presidential aspirants that are not from Southeast to disintegrate or cost Nigeria her national unity."It's derogatory that Atiku Abubakar boasted how he used Ben Obi and Peter Obi as running mates. Atiku Abubakar should know that if any Nigerian desires to see Nigeria as the 'Giant of Africa' as proposed by Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe (Zik of Africa), then it's high time he dropped his presidential ambition and support a credible and competent presidential aspirant from Southeast to build the Nigeria of Zik vision."Atiku Abubakar must awaken his human consciousness and realise that among the six geo-political zones in Nigeria, Southeast gave him the overwhelming highest vote, which led the present administration of President Muhammadu Buhari to nickname Southeastern people 5%. Therefore, it is historical that Atiku Abubakar and PDP family is owing the Southeastern people a reciprocation gratitude in 2023 presidential election.”
