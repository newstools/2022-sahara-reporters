A group of women in Ondo State have called on Governor Rotimi Akeredolu to consider paying compensation to farmers whose farmlands and produces have been destroyed by rampaging Fulani herdsmen.The group, the Small Scale Women Farmers Organisation in Nigeria (SWOFON) made the demand on Thursday in Akure at an occasion organised by Life and Peace Development Organisation to celebrate the international women's day.The State coordinator of the group, Mrs. Grace Oyediji explained that the cattle menace remained a big threat to the survival of women farmers in all the 18 local government areas of the state.Oyediji explained that most of the women, who are into farming, sourced loans only for cattle to ravage them produce, describing such action as tragic and devastating.She, however, decried the attitude of the government to the plight of women who are into farming in the state."Worse still, there are no forms of compensation to such victims since they are not aware of the state policy which facilitates women-friendly environment and security. We need gender-friendly machines."To redress the trend and break the barrier and the bias in line with this year’s WD Campaign, we are calling on local government authority to, among other things, create awareness of policy environment in the agricultural sector that will support the needs of smallholder women farmers including those living with disabilities in the LGAs in Ondo State."It is also imperative for Ondo state local government authorities to enhance and empower smallholder women farmers in the 18 LGAs to add values to their produce."We want Agro Women initiative domicile across the 18 local government areas of the state and we want farmers in rural areas to benefit from it".Oyediji harped on the need to find a lasting solution to the farmers-herders crisis in the state.While identifying the challenges facing women who are into farming to include the absence of farm equipment, Oyediji said lack of financial support most especially from the government has hindered them from progressing."Government should find a lasting solution to the farmers-herders crises in the state with a view to ending the destruction of farmlands by cattle and as well as consider payment of compensation to victims as a means of support."What has become the order of the day is that the enabling environment is not there for smallholder women farmers to survive."Since there are no tractors or equipment to work within the state, we have to travel out of the state to rent such."The same is applicable to chemicals and other agro-inputs needed to facilitate agricultural product.”She added that the scarcity of the Premium Motor Spirit best known as petrol is also having a huge toll on their farming business.
