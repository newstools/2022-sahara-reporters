Tech billionaire Elon Musk has challenged Vladimir Putin to a one-on-one battle for the future of Ukraine.Musk bids to end the invasion of Ukraine launched by Putin. Musk on Monday in a tweet challenged the Russian President to a one-on-one challenge, with the future of Ukraine on the line.He wrote: "I hereby challenge Владимир Путин (Vladimir Putin) to single combat."Stakes are Україна (Ukraine)."Putin's name and the name of Ukraine were presumably put in Russian so that Putin would not miss out on the challenge.One user asked Musk, in Russian, if he would be "surprised" if the despotic Russian leader accepted the challenge, to which he replied: "It would be an honour".He followed this on with another tweet reading "Вы согласны на этот бой?" - translating to "do you agree to this fight?" He tagged @KremlinRussia_E - the Kremlin's official Instagram account - in the second tweet. Musk made known his support for Ukraine late last month by activating Space X's Starlink satellites.The challenge quickly went viral, with crypto expert Travladd Crypto tweeting: "I need some of what you're drinking, brother". And @GreenTeaMonster wrote: "I think it's best for world leaders to settle this man to man. "So Zelensky vs. Putin. Also if the world changed the rules that world leaders would have to fight instead of their military, I think we can all agree that Manny Pacquiao should win this next election."Within minutes of the challenge being made, the 50-year-old founder of SpaceX and Tesla's tweet - to his 77.6 million followers - had been retweeted more than 6,800 times, with more than 32,000 likes
