McDonald's has announced it will temporarily close all restaurants and pause all operations in Russia. The fast-food chain has around 850 stores and 62,000 employees.  McDonald's had been facing growing criticism for not following many other food and drinks brands by pulling out of the country after the invasion of Ukraine, BBC News reports. In a statement, its CEO Chris Kempczinski says the conflict has "caused unspeakable suffering to innocent people" and "we join the world in condemning aggression and violence and praying for peace". A number of luxury brands have suspended operations in Russia because of the invasion of Ukraine. The invasion of Ukraine – which the Kremlin insists should be called a ‘special military operation’ – has resulted in crippling Western sanctions which are hitting the economy hard. The impact on ordinary Russians is already being felt. Russia’s currency, the ruble, has crashed, and prices for a whole range of goods and services are rising fast - including travelling abroad. Foreign travel itself is now much harder – the US, EU and others have closed their airspace to Russian aircraft. Thousands of young, educated Russians have already left the country. Several large Russian supermarkets are limiting the number of basic goods people can buy at one time. The list of Western companies pulling out of Russia grows ever longer. Before the invasion, Moscow was one of the most technologically advanced and well-connected cities in the world – with a first-class system of streaming services, online payments, tech and digital services. Using cash was rare. But with companies such as Apple, Visa and Netflix curtailing or shutting down in Russia, these services are grinding to a halt.
