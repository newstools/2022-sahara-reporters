A video of governors' wives presenting a birthday cake to Aisha Buhari, Nigeria's First Lady had gone viral on social media attracting the outrage of some Nigerians. Bisi Fayemi, wife of the Ekiti State governor, was seen holding a cake while leading the other women who presented the cake to Aisha during her 51st birthday in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates.  Some citizens had condemned the gesture as they queried why the First Lady had made Dubai her permanent city of residence. Also, some lambasted the President Muhammadu Buhari's administration as they compared it to that of the former President, Goodluck Jonathan who was accused of corruption. This, according to the users, is happening at a time the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) is on strike and at a period that hardship is biting hard at Nigerians.Below are some of the reactions: Nigeria's governors' wives led by Bisi Fayemi travelled to Dubai to present Aisha Buhari with a birthday cake. No fuel in Nigeria for the common man but Aisha and her husband can enjoy life outside of Nigeria while citizens suffer! pic.twitter.com/MruKvrbzjG Nigerian Governors Wives fly to Dubai to present Aisha Buhari with birthday cake while ASUU is on strike.

They left us to our faith, Went to dubai to celebrate some mediocre birthday celebrations that's not worth it. Aren't they our leaders? Who's supposed to be here in Nigeria making things better ð Until Nigeria's constitution makes politicians become accountable things like this would continue to happen. Can't imagine this happening in developed countries.Who funded this trip?Taxpayers money? The National Assembly is passing bills that affect the dignity of Nigerian women, yet the governors wives think it's a better idea to go wish Aisha Buhari happy birthday in far away Dubai. Nonsense and misplaced priorities https://t.co/kPNtF2SZ22 Gov's wives led by Bisi Fayemi went to Dubai to present a cake to Aisha Buhari on her birthday.
