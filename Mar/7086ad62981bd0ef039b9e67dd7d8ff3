The organised Labour in Niger State, on Wednesday, commenced indefinite strike action, extending its 14-day ongoing warning strike.  This was made known by the chairman of the state chapter of Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Comrade Yakubu Garba.  The industrial action followed the breakdown in talks between labour officials and Niger State Government. Civil servants in the state had earlier gone on a warning strike from midnight of Monday March 7, 2022. The directive was contained in a statement signed by the NLC chairman in the state, Garba, after a State Executive Council (SEC) meeting.  The statement directed all affiliate unions of NLC across the 25 local councils of the state to proceed on the warning strike after the expiration of the 14-day ultimatum issued to state government.  The statement said workers in the state would “begin seven days warning strike in solidarity with the primary school teachers and local council workers over payment of monthly salary on percentage for six months.  “The warning strike is to press home the demand of workers such as payment of backlog of gratuity, refund of deductions from cooperatives, National Housing Fund (NHF), unions’ check off dues as well as third party charge deductions from workers’ salary for Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS).”
