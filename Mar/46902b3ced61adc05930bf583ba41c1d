Some radio stations in Nigeria on Friday announced the cutting down on their hours of operation.SaharaReporters had earlier reported that the Broadcasting Organisation of Nigeria warned that television and radio stations in the country might shut down their operations over the persistent fuel scarcity and skyrocketing diesel prices. Yemisi Bamgbose, executive secretary of BON, stated that broadcast stations could no longer cope with the lingering fuel scarcity and skyrocketing prices of the black market fuel.“There is a lingering scarcity of petroleum products and diesel, which fuels the generating sets of these organisations, has more than doubled in price over the last four months,” reads part of the statement.Bamgbose stressed that broadcast stations which rely heavily on fuel to power their machines and keep them running at an optimal temperature to avoid overheating, are now running at a loss which has caused a delay in staff salaries.“With diesel costs averaging more than N700 per litre and having to resort to buying petrol from the black market at more than N2,000 per litre, broadcast organisations are recording such huge deficits that have resulted in staff salaries being delayed,” said the BON executive secretary.According to her, the shutdown of TV and radio stations will pose a huge security threat to the dissemination of fact-checked information.Meanwhile, one of the radio stations in a letter signed by the management and titled 'announcement', said the decision was taken due to high cost of diesel in the country. Here are notices from some radio stations;The letter reads in part; "Due to the diesel scarcity and the poor power supply we would like to notify all Hot FM Abuja listeners and partners that the station will be adjusting transmission times until the current situation improves."Transmission will now commence daily from 5.00 am until 9:30pm. Thank you for your cooperation and understanding."
