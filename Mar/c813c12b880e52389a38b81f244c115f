In 2022, the average has risen to 107. But this apparent progress is masking a growing divide in mobility — and the resulting access to opportunities — between citizens in the wealthy global north and those in the lower-income global south, which includes many fragile states... “Against this backdrop of increasing disparity, high-net-worth investors and entrepreneurs are looking to create portfolios of complementary citizenship and residence options in multiple jurisdictions through investment migration programs, to access health security and optionality in terms of where they and their families can comfortably live, conduct business, study, and invest. “Even those from advanced economies with premium passports can see the value in having choice and creating different options that will help spread risk, provide new opportunities, and mitigate against an increasingly volatile world.”  Henley Passport Index 2022 q1 Infographic Global Ranking 220113 1 by Sahara Reporters on Scribd
