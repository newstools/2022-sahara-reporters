A former chairman of the Nigeria Union of Journalists in Bayelsa, Olusegun Osahon, has been abducted by gunmen suspected to be Fulani herdsmen. The Bayelsa State correspondent of the Guardian Newspaper and other passengers in a commercial bus owned by Sunny Eru Motors were kidnapped by bandits along the Patani axis of the East-West road.  The gunmen also shot dead the driver with Sunny Eru Motors, just as they kidnapped 18 passengers. The incident occurred on Monday, March 29, when the journalist was returning from the Press Centre in Bayelsa State. At the time of this report, the gunmen have called the wife of the journalist, demanding N5million ransom. A Warri-based lawyer, Lucky Egboyi Esq, who narrowly escaped from the scene, confirmed this in Warri. The legal practitioner, who was returning from Bayelsa State where he went for a matter, said they ran into the Fulani herdsmen operating in the road. He disclosed that the Fulani herdsmen shot the Sunny Eru driver in the head and kidnapped several passengers. The Chairman of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, NUJ Warri Correspondents’ Chapel, Comrade Okies Veeky in a chat, said, “This news is saddening and appalling. That shows that there’s no good security network in that area, nay the whole of Delta State. “The DSS, the Army and the Police should all live up to expectations. They should try and help us. We are living in an unsecured society. The journalist is a former Chairman of the NUJ Bayelsa State. His abduction is a condemnable act. This is very bad and the security agencies should wake up and do something.”
