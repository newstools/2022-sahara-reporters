Residents of Amankwo in Orsu Local Government Area of Imo State have fled the community after an attack by members of Ebubeagu security outfit, who killed a yet-to-be ascertained number of people. Governors of the South-East region had in April 2021 unveiled Ebubeagu to aid in the fight against insecurity.  Operatives of the security outfit were said to have stormed Amankwo community on Monday, shooting sporadically. Residents told SaharaReporters that the local security operatives also set ablaze a market in the community known as Nkwo-Idemili. A couple was said to be among those killed during the attack on the community. SaharaReporters gathered that the incident resulted in serious panic as residents ran into neighboring villages for safety. “Hope Uzodimma's so-called Ebubeagu descended on the market in my community on Monday, torched and razed down the timber section of the market. “The attack continued till last night (Thursday) and left a couple and many others dead. The town is deserted now. “This is daily occurrence in all neighboring towns in my local government of Orsu. Everyone is living in fear. Please help us beg the government to stop these siege and senseless killings,” a resident told SaharaReporters.
