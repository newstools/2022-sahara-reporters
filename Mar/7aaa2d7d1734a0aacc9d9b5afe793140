The Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt Gen Faruk Yahaya, has ordered troops of the Nigerian Army and other security agencies to intensify their search and rescue operations to ensure that the kidnapped victims are rescued unconditionally. Terrorists had earlier attacked the Nigerian Railway Corporation train from Abuja to Kaduna on Monday evening, and abducted some of the stranded passengers.  SaharaReporters obtained victims’ accounts which confirmed that some other persons were shot dead by the rampaging terrorists who operated for hours due to the absence of the Nigerian military and other security agencies. On Tuesday, the Chief of Army Staff who visited the scene of the attack was accompanied by some principal staff officers of the Army Headquarters and the General Officer Commanding 1 Division. According to a statement by Director, Army Public Relations, Onyema Nwachukwu, the army chief assessed the security situation around the general area of the attack and inspected the attacked train, as well as the rail track to evaluate the degree of damage. He ordered the troops to intensify their search and rescue operations to ensure that the kidnapped victims were rescued unconditionally. “The COAS has also assured Nigerians that the troops will be undeterred and vehement in the fight against banditry and other forms of criminality. He urged members of the surrounding communities and all Nigerians to continue to avail troops with credible information to enhance their operations across the country. “Gen Yahaya observed that the attack reverberated the need for critical stakeholders to review the security of railways across the country in order to achieve the desired security architecture for railway transportation,” the statement added.
