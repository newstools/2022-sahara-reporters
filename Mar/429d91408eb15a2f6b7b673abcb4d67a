The Nigeria Police Force has released human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore, who was detained earlier on Monday.SaharaReporters had reported how armed police men attached to the Inspector-General of Police Intelligence Response Team (IRT) located at Guzape, Abuja illegally arrested the activist. He had reported to police after the Force claimed he had jumped bail.Sowore, who arrived at the facility at about 12:30pm, was accompanied by his lawyer, Pelumi Olajengbesi and other activists in solidarity.However, they were attacked and assaulted by armed policemen stationed at the gate.The activist had announced on social media that he would be heading to the defunct police Special Anti-Robbery Squad unit to see its Commander so as to obtain the charges which they claimed were filed against him by a former member of the House of Representatives, Ned Nwoko.The activists who were singing solidarity songs while approaching the gate were violently stopped as they engaged Sowore in a shouting match, asking him to ask his lawyers and supporters to go back.But when the activist was about to explain to them that he was there to make himself available to the police to prove that he had not jumped bail and not on the run as claimed, the policemen assaulted him.They dragged Sowore inside the facility and beat up other activists with him. Some of the activists were also arrested in the process.The police also attacked some lawyers and journalists who were trying to film the scene.The situation also led to sporadic shooting by the police in the area, as they tried to forcibly disperse the crowd.On his Facebook, Sowore wrote, “I have returned home after another idiotic outing with the highly corrupt and compromised Nigeria Police Force after the criminal so-called Billionaire Ned Nwoko, Ned Nwoko Foundation tried another trick.“The @policeng had to inform him of every move just so they can milk Ned. But we know why, they are afraid! They brutalised and tortured our comrades, it was another shameful day of police brutality and impunity, however, these attacks and dehumanisation could only hasten their day of judgement. #freemarshalabubakarnow #SoworeForPresident #SoworeForPresident #TakeItBack #RevolutionNow.”
