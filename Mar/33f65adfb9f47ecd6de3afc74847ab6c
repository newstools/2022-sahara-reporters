Ukrainian defence officials have announced the recapturing of the eastern city of Chuhuiv by its army.According to the Ukrainian General Staff, the defending forces seized the city from the Russians and inflicted heavy losses on President Vladimir Putin’s men in both personnel and equipment. "In the course of hostilities, the city of Chuhuiv was liberated. The occupiers suffered heavy losses in personnel and equipment," the General Staff said in an operational update on Facebook.The Ukrainian army also claimed to have killed two high-ranking Russian military commanders: Lt. Col. Dmitry Safronov, commander of the 61st Separate Marine Brigade of the Russian Armed Forces, and Lt. Col. Denis Glebov, deputy commander of the 11th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade, according to Newsweek.Chuhuiv is a strategic city of 31,000 people located 23 miles from Kharkiv, the second biggest city in Ukraine which has been subjected to intense bombardment.Chuhuiv was among the first places to report damage caused by shelling after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24.Two five-storey apartment buildings were destroyed on the first day of Russia's invasion by heavy shelling, which left a missile crater some four to five meters wide carved into the ground.Meanwhile, Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky has vowed that “God will not forgive” and Ukraine “will not forget” the slaughter of civilians by Russian, saying a “day of judgment” is coming for them.Zelensky, in a late-night address to his countrymen on the Orthodox Christian holiday of 'Forgiveness Sunday', recalled how a family of four were among eight civilians killed by Russian mortars while trying to flee the city of Irpin - near Kyiv - earlier in the day.“We will not forgive. We will not forget. We cannot forgive the hundreds upon hundreds of victims; nor the thousands upon thousands who have suffered. God will not forgive; not today. Not tomorrow; never.”
