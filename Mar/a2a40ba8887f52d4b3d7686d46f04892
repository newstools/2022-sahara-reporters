The House of Representatives has rejected a bill that sought to check public office holders from sending their children to foreign schools.The bill sponsored by Sergius Ogun was rejected by the members of the House of Representatives on Thursday. In 2018, the same bill was sponsored by Ogun but most of his colleagues argued at the time that the bill should be stepped down as it “infringes on people’s rights.”Leading the debate, Ogun argued that the bill will help to address the fallen standard in Nigerian public schools.“This bill is proposed against the background of fallen standards in our educational system and the need to bring the sector up to speed with global best standards.“Unfortunately, as a result of the inability of the government to provide quality education in its public educational institutions, Nigerians have resorted to private schools and foreign schools for their education,” he said.His argument did not sway his colleagues, as they argued against his points.Nicholas Ossai from Delta State said the bill violates the individual rights of Nigerians. He argued that the bill should be withdrawn.The bill was subsequently stepped down.
