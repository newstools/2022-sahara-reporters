Contenders for the office of the All Progressives Congress national chairman submitted their expression of interest and nomination forms at the party’s national secretariat in Abuja ahead of the March 26 national convention of the party. Party sources had claimed President Muhammadu Buhari endorsed Senator Abdullahi Adamu at a crucial meeting of APC stakeholders in Aso Rock. Al-Makura “The President, at the brief meeting, told us that the party chairman should come from the North Central and that the person should be Senator Abdullahi Adamu. Nobody disagreed with him,” a source had said. But despite the endorsement, other aspirants vying for the chairmanship seat refused to withdraw from the race. On Friday, there was a mad rush among aspirants who submitted their forms on Friday. While some of the aspirants personally appeared for submission, others submitted their forms by proxy. The Senator representing Niger East, Senator Sani Musa; a former governor of Nasarawa State, Tanko Al-Makura; a former governor of Benue State and current Minister of Special Duties and Intergovernmental Affairs, Senator George Akume, all submitted their forms. Others,.who turned in their forms after filling them were a former deputy national chairman of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change, Saliu Mustapha; a former governor of Nasarawa State, Abdullahi Adamu, and Mohammed Saidu Etsu. In an interview with newsmen after submitting his forms, Senator Musa said the party did not inform the aspirants of any consensus candidate for the office of national chairman as is being speculated. When asked, Senator Musa said, “Why did the party sell forms to us? As far as I’m concerned, there has never been anybody that officially contacted me or any other aspirants. Nobody; and the spokesperson to Mr President, Femi Adesina, had said there is no endorsement.”
