Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State on Saturday said the Peoples Democratic Party will stop at nothing to reclaim the Ebonyi governorship seat following the defection of the governor, David Umahi, to the All Progressives Congress. Wike, who spoke during the inauguration of the Eastern Bypass Road in Port Harcourt on Saturday, urged Umahi, to return the mandate he got on the platform of the PDP. Nyesom Wike He said it was unfortunate that instead of seeking an appeal to the judgment of the court, the Ebonyi governor resorted to making a reckless statement against the judge. Wike further disclosed that he had written a letter to the National Chairman of the PDP, Iyorchia Ayu, demanding disciplinary action against the Edo State deputy governor, Philip Shuaibu, for his remarks against the party. He said, “Look at a governor making a reckless statement simply because a judge made a judgment according to his own opinion, which you are entitled to appeal up to Supreme Court. “You have called somebody a thief in the market and you’re saying I’m sorry, It is late. That you’re sorry, we the members of the public, we don’t take it. “You give somebody an umbrella and the next day he defects. EFCC will come, he will say let me join them so EFCC will not go against me. You carry the vote of another party and join another party. Can you transfer votes? If you are defecting, leave the seat. “And this will checkmate most of these political harlots who will never sit one place, looking for excuses here and there. “Governor Umahi, be rest assured that PDP will continue this matter down to Supreme Court.” Umahi earlier this week was sacked by a Federal High Court in Abuja for defecting to the APC from the PDP. However, the governor has applied for a stay of execution and approached the Court of Appeal for a review.
