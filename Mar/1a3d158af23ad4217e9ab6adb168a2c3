Kanunta Kanu, a brother of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, has warned the Nigerian government against its “aggression” in the South-East region. Kanu, in a tweet on Wednesday, said the Nigerian government needed to learn from the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine referring to the defence Ukraine had been able to put up despite engaging in a war with a superpower.

This, he said would begin in the next 48 hours. His tweet reads, “Dear @GovNigeria: Let it be clear that 2022 is not 1967. Take a lesson from the Russian-Ukrainian war. “If you continue with your aggression in Biafra, men will be on the street of #Biafraland within 48 hours. We have to defend ourselves @FCDOGovUK @StateDept @UKParliament @UN.” Nnamdi Kanu is currently in the custody of the Department of State Services, DSS, over his agitation for Biafra. The Nigerian government had dragged Kanu to court over charges bordering on terrorism. The IPOB leader had been detained since June 2021, after his extraordinary rendition from Kenya. Since Kanu's arrest, the army had launched military operations in the southeast region which the military said was part of measures to curtail the worsening insecurity in the region. Also, there has been clampdown on members of the IPOB military wing, Eastern Security Network leading to the death of scores of the ESN members.
