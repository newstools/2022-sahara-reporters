Nigerians on the microblogging platform, Twitter, have called for a review of the number of weeks allowed for maternity leave in private and public organisations in the country. The reactions trailed a tweet by @Lolo_cy, who shared the sad story of a three-month-old baby who died at a creche without any explanation.According to the tweet, the baby had barely started resuming at the creche before the unfortunate incident. She said, on the fateful day, the mother dropped a healthy baby in the creche only to come back to pick her baby's dead body.The story has attracted sympathy from Nigerians who have since highlighted the importance of a longer period of maternity leave for women coupled with a possibly shorter one for their husbands. Tweeps argued that maternity leave in some private organisations does not extend beyond six weeks, leaving the nursing mother with no option but to leave her baby at a creche — a nursery where babies and young children are cared for during the working day.Others suggested that organisations should establish small creche centres in their offices for nursing mothers who are also staff members.Below are some of the reactions on Twitter:https://twitter.com/Ayoappeal/status/1500463231315464195?t=RMR3siYwqQS8ygkDSkXAaQ&s=19https://twitter.com/ChineduAdikwu/status/1500498150284537856?t=AAL11Eirr0UE5LZ6CErrPg&s=19https://twitter.com/TheFolashade/status/1500436543399510020?t=-NnJDmO2frT0EJjg1N6S_g&s=19https://twitter.com/ahmasassy/status/1500738704612245504?t=oje4kyunLS0WmXNc3mXtJQ&s=19https://twitter.com/SeunCute/status/1500555300218228740?t=q5ljlXMPRS1RrsLPgYddog&s=19https://twitter.com/nneomamd/status/1500481896286867459?t=dbuWsE7M8a_6ZH8AvrJJcA&s=19https://twitter.com/Vav_Omoluwabi/status/1500660397623451650?t=fGOrjed9WN5r9EU_xRLX7g&s=19https://twitter.com/aduke_olounje1/status/1500550918357532678?t=oh4R3lbs-ZFAbpYD2G_lnw&s=19https://twitter.com/BolajiOyebode/status/1500728922018877441?t=agF69tkqD9hooYNsLeOZsQ&s=19https://twitter.com/abelpter/status/1500442207362428935?t=-oOgrUYpSIIIuDpiDt00TQ&s=19https://twitter.com/Omomemi/status/1500505870756679691?t=kgPSfisqbopECOHf0e7jLg&s=19https://twitter.com/francysmylz/status/1500570777669804037?t=Np-PG5TsEEIt3WWUEI853Q&s=19https://twitter.com/theoldl77665968/status/1500484856719024134?t=wI7lv6cvFmgcxFLPf1cGvA&s=19https://twitter.com/snowice91/status/1500546120673546249?t=xdUUqK6OsS8qckqqkcDpRA&s=19https://twitter.com/FerrzAk/status/1500550265438711808?t=KF5adpg8iU0lfuQ0L8RYzw&s=19https://twitter.com/chiefUdu/status/1500565404879577089?t=oo1mOVxAHJ3FNTduxScHuQ&s=19https://twitter.com/only1estar/status/1500550411333390337?t=U97BuZtg8sQQ0rMxeP0lmQ&s=19https://twitter.com/Tcurtis01/status/1500466306285510666?t=I3lO9vjXuQbpn0lN1OiCIQ&s=19
