The United Kingdom Ministry of Defence has said that Russian military is calling up reinforcements from across the entire country, as it has been losing a lot of personnel. Russia was said to redeploying forces from as far away as "its Eastern Military District, Pacific Fleet and Armenia" and was increasingly tapping other sources of fighters such as "private military companies, Syrians, and other mercenaries," according to the latest public intelligence assessment released Tuesday, March 15 by the UK ministry, Russian President Vladimir Putin
UK Telegraph The UK assessment further said that Russia faced with “continued personnel losses in Ukraine” is increasingly seeking to generate additional troops to bolster and replace its personnel losses. “It is likely Russia is struggling to conduct offensive operations in the face of sustained Ukrainian resistance. “Russia will likely attempt to use these forces to hold captured territory and free up its combat power to renew stalled offensive operations." This comes a day after reports emerged that Russia has asked China for economic and military assistance and Putin's message last week asking for foreign fighters to help with its military invasion of Ukraine.
