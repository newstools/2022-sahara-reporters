In Katsina State, Northwest region where President Muhammadu Buhari hails from, women in communities now contribute money to raise ransoms for kidnapped family members of fellow villagers. SaharaReporters learnt that they also sell farmlands, houses and cooking utensils, in extreme cases to be able to raise the demanded ransoms.   Just last week, the villagers contributed N26million ransom for bandits to free a traditional ruler in Guga Village in Bakori Local Government Area, Alhaji Umar, alongside 35 others who stayed in captivity for 29 days. The bandits reportedly attacked the village on February 7, killing 10 people and abducting 36 others, including the monarch. Two days after the abduction, the gunmen demanded a ransom of N30million to release them. However, after a prolonged negotiation, the terrorists agreed to accept N10million but they reneged on their promise after taking delivery of the money. As gathered, the bandits explained that the N10million was compensation for their slain comrades. Consequently, they opened fresh negotiation window, demanding N20million before they would free the monarch and 36 others. "We had to auction valuables like farmlands, landed property and dishes for serving meals to raise N16million ransom. Everyone in the village, including those whose relations were not kidnapped contributed some money to complete the ransom. "Women were not left out, they also had to dispose of their expensive dishes, ceramics plates and other utensils to help make up the N16 million", Abdullahi Umar, son of the monarch said.
