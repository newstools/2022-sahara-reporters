Two four-year-olds, Wasiu Dauda and Alimeen Ibrahim, have been abducted in the Ijesha area of Lagos. The little boys, both four-year-olds, were discovered missing on Friday, two hours after they returned from school.  A man was said to have lured them into a tricycle and whisked them away while they were playing around the vicinity. A relative of victims said the children were abducted on Friday at Akorede market at around 6:30 p.m. “The oldest boy where they were playing, Sunday told us that a man took the two boys away on the pretext of buying gifts for them,” he said. “Truly went to the mallam and he confirmed selling biscuits to them. He added that the boys were led into a tricycle after that.” The development comes hours after a dispatch rider was discovered with a baby in his courier box in the Sangotedo area of the state.
