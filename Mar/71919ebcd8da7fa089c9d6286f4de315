Ukrainian forces have retaken control of the town of Chuhuiv in northeastern Ukraine, according to presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych. We don't have any more details at this stage, Sky News reports.  The town is in the Kharkiv region, where fighting has been heavy since Russia launched its invasion 12 days ago. Separately, Ukraine forces have retaken the regional airport in the Mykolayiv region, the local governor has said. While analysts predict Russia should have enough resources to take key parts of Ukraine, holding them could be trickier - with the potential for a drawn-out guerrilla struggle. Advancing forces are also required to leave behind troops to hold the gained territory - so the force moving forward becomes thinner. Meanwhile, further south, part of the Ukrainian port of Olvia has been hit by a military "strike", Ukraine's infrastructure ministry has said. Nobody has been wounded in the attack at the Black Sea port, which is in the Mykolaiv region. It comes after the country claimed an area in its key port city of Odesa was subjected to a missile strike in the early hours of this morning.
