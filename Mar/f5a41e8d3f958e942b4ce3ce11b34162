The Acting Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Abubakar Sani-Bello has inaugurated chairmen and secretaries of sub-committees for the March 26th National Convention of the party.Sani-Bello is also the governor of Niger State.The new panels have however been reduced to a manageable size for effective delivery, according to Sani-Bello.Sani-Bello took over on Monday as the acting chairman of the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, CECPC amid tight security. This followed the removal of Mai Mala Buni by President Muhammadu Buhari. The then National Secretary of CECPC, James Akpanudoedehe, had debunked the report, describing it as fake news. As early as 7am, a team of combat-ready heavily armed security operatives had sealed up the entire Blantyre Street, Wuse 2 housing the national secretariat of APC, denying entry to vehicles. Tension was high as journalists and staffers were initially barred from accessing the secretariat before being eventually granted access afterwards.
