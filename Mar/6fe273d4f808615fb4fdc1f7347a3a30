Many Nigerians have described the current administration under President Muhammadu Buhari as the least competent and worse in the history of Nigeria.Nigerians have been battling with fuel scarcity since February which is said to have been caused by the importation of adulterated fuel.The Nigerian government assured Nigerians that normalcy would soon return because it has enough fuel.However, rather than a definite solution to the challenges, Nigerians have experienced a hike in charges at the fuel stations as some stations sell fuel at about N210 per litre and diesel at N700/800 per litre.SaharaReporters had on Tuesday reported that the power grid serving Nigerians collapsed again, the second time in 48 hours.A total system collapse means total blackout nationwide in most parts of the country.Eko Electricity and other power distributors on Tuesday evening reported the development and apologised to customers.“We would like to inform you of another system collapse on the National Grid which occurred at 5:10pm today,” Eko Electricity said in a statement.Also, the Academic Staff Union of Universities extended its warning strike by two months.The decision to extend the strike was taken at the union’s National Executive Council, NEC meeting held in Abuja on Sunday night.The union made the resolve after the federal government failed to meet its demands which includes; the revitalisation of public universities, earned academic allowances, University Transparency Accountability Solution (UTAS) promotion arrears, renegotiation of 2009 ASUU-FGN agreement and alleged inconsistencies in Integrated Payroll and Personnel information system (IPPIS) payments.Amid all these challenges, the President, Muhammadu Buhari had again jet out of the country and is currently in London, the UK attending to his health, as is his usual practice.President Buhari on March 6 departed Abuja for a routine medical check-up in London.The First Lady, Aisha Buhari had also permanently relocated to the United Arab Emirates, SaharaReporters reports.Nigerians on social media have expressed their anger at the current situation of the country.
