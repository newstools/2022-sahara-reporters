The Northern Elders Forum (NEF), through its Director of Public Affairs, Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, had said the 2023 Nigerian elections would be tough. Baba- Ahmed while sharing his thoughts via his known Twitter handle on Monday, warned his compatriots against electing leaders who would “become our problems.”  “Now our political parties will decide who we vote for or against in 2023.They should know that Nigerians will reject poor and bad choices. They may decide candidates, but voters will decide who wins. We want leaders who will fix problems, not become our problems. 2023 will be tough,” he wrote on his known Twitter handle. Presidential and National Assembly elections have been slated for February 25, 2023 while governorship and state assembly elections will now be held on March 11, 2023. With President Muhammadu Buhari having been elected to the office of president twice, he is ineligible for reelection.
