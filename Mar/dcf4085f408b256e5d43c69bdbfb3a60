Google It was learnt that the gunmen on Wednesday sent mercenaries and issued a threat to people living in Torkula Village in the same Guma LGA to vacate the community or face the consequences.  Torkula is the ancestral home of the late paramount ruler of Tiv nation, HRM Alfred Akawe Torkula.  Nathaniel Ikyur, Chief Press Secretary to Governor Samuel Ortom, confirmed the threat in a statement while reacting to Thursday’s attack.  “Eyewitness account said the Fulani terrorists who had earlier issued a threat to the Tse Torkula community, asking them to leave the village or face dire consequences, came on motorcycles and without any herd of cattle,” the governor’s spokesperson said.  “Torkula is the ancestral home of the late Tor Tiv IV, HRM Alfred Akawe Torkula,” he added.
