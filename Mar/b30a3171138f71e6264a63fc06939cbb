A young man allegedly killed by the members of the Park Manager System (PMS) otherwise known as National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), Kabiru Olalekan, popularly called Kokoro, has been buried amidst tears in his Ibadan, Oyo State family house.The deceased was buried without his head but other parts of his were complete. SaharaReporters had reported that Olalekan was killed when the PMS boys invaded Sunday Igboho's house in the Soka area of Ibadan over a controversial issue on February 12, 2022.It had been gathered that after the deceased was killed in Soka, his remains were deposited without his head in a bush close to Idi Ayunre, about 15 kilometres from where he was killed.According to a source closed to PMS, some powerful politicians in the government were behind the death of the deceased.The source further told SaharaReporters that while the family and friends of the deceased were struggling to recover his corpse, some top politicians instructed the police at the Oluyole division not to release his remains.SaharaReporters gathered when the remains of the deceased were discovered by some youths in the Idi Ayunre area of Ibadan, two aged women were used to convey the body from the bush because the police were monitoring the corpse.The source said the aged women could not be questioned further after they claimed Olalekan was their child but the DPO in Idi Ayunre demanded for proper documentation before releasing the corpse.When the corpse was later released to them, it was a sad moment in the family house as family, friends and children of the deceased were weeping when the remains were lowered to the grave.Speaking on the development, a leader of PMS in the state said, “Kokoro was also a strong man but he didn't deserve to be killed like an animal. If my boss goes away with this, anything could happen to anyone. This is a guy that has children and family but he was killed just like that."Leaders of our union in Soka and the DPO in Oluyole local government need to tell us how the remains of Kokoro got to Idi Ayunre. I am not really concerned about this because he has been killed already but what about those of us alive? This could happen to anyone."Please help us to disseminate this information so that ‘Auxiliary’ and other thugs in the state will be careful. We cannot continue to kill our fellow brothers. Governor Makinde needs to caution Auxiliary’s boys.”
