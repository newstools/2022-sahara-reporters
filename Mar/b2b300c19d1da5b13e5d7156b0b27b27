Yoruba Nation activist, Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho, Wednesday said he hoped there would be no war. This was revealed in a video in which Igboho was discussing the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia.Igboho on Monday secured his release from a detention facility in the Benin Republic government. He was released to renowned Yoruba historian, Prof Banji Akintoye, who has been also been agitating for a referendum in Nigeria that is expected to birth a separate Yoruba nation. “Let’s hope that this Ukraine crisis won’t lead to a third world war. May God not let us witness war in the world,” Igboho said in the video.However, one of the lawyers representing the agitator, Yomi Alliyu, SAN, had said Igboho was only released to attend to his health in a Beninese hospital. Alliyu said, “Igboho has not been released; he was only released to be taken to the hospital to attend to his ill health. The last time we spoke, I told you that we were making arrangements to take him to the hospital; over his ill health. So, he was released based on health grounds. “I am to inform you that Chief Sunday Adeyemo has been released from prison to his medical practitioners under the agreement that he should not leave the medical centre or Cotonou for any reason.“Praises should be given to two prominent Yoruba personalities to wit Prof Wole Soyinka and Prof Banji Akintoye for this turnaround in our client’s matter."
