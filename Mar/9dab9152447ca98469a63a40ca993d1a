Youths numbering over 200 under the umbrella of Isoko Development Union Youths Wing, (IDU Youths Wing), on Monday protested and barricaded the ever busy Emevor-Iyede-Ughelli Asaba expressway, Isoko North Local Government Area of Delta State following what they called marginaliSation by the Delta State Government.The mass protest which disrupted economic and official activities caused gridlock for several hours leaving travellers stranded while commuters made diversions through other routes. The protesters armed with placards bearing different inscriptions such as “Okowa failed to meet with Isoko Youths”, "We demand the release of the N10million Social  Security Fund Isoko Youths,” “Isoko Youths Tell Okowa to Respect Isoko Tradition,” among others, vowed to continue to protest and demand for their rights till the governor listen.The N10million is a monthly largesse from the state government to youths from ethnic nationalities across the state, channelled through the Delta State Oil Producing Area Commission, (DESOPADEC), which the commission's Managing Director, Askia Ogieh, had allegedly refused to release to the IDU youths wing for several months.President of the IDU Youth wing, Fidelis Obokpaino, who led the protest, stated that the protest was as a result of the marginalisation of the IDU youth wing by the Delta state government and the multinationals oil companies operating in Isoko land."Isoko Development Union, Youths Wing was created 16months ago saddled with the responsibilities of handling all Youths activities in Isoko nation.  But since its creation till now, the State Government has resolved not to give IDU Youth Wing attention for interaction. We are being denied of our Corporate Social Responsibilities by the Multinationals Oil Companies operating in Isoko Land. And whenever we approached the Oil Companies for dialogue, they refused granting us audience.“That's why we are here to express our displeasure to the state government and all multinationals oil companies operating in Isoko that enough is enough, we the Isoko youths say no to marginalisation. We are therefore demanding an interactive session with the state government to present our demands to Governor Ifeanyi Okowa and also with the multinational oil companies operating in Isoko land.”Addressing the aggrieved protesting youths, the Speaker, Delta State House of Assembly, Sheriff Oborevwori, who was caught up in the protest on his way to Asaba, appealed to the protesting youths to remain calm with a promise to look into their demands and present same to the state governor for action.
