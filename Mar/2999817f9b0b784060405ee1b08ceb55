Civil rights advocacy group, the Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, has urged the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration to rise quickly and stop the unending carnage in Kaduna State.The group condemned the unending bloodbath and chaos in Kaduna State, North-West Nigeria, which it said were obvious signs of descent into anarchy. HURIWA made this known in a statement by its National Coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko, saying that it was unfortunate that Kaduna had become a killing field for bandits and terrorists who operate while security agents allegedly looked away.The group’s warning came amid a fresh raid by gunmen suspected to be Fulani militia at Agban Kagoro, Kaura Local Government Area of the state on Sunday which claimed no fewer than 15 lives while scores were injured.“The fresh killings on Sunday in Kaura LGA by rampaging terrorists pampered by security agents were worrisome, heinous, condemnable and despicable.“It is more worrisome because the military has a heavy presence in Kaduna with no fewer than six military formations in the city. The military formations include Jaji Military Cantonment; 1 Mech. Division Headquarters, Nigerian Army, Kaduna; New Barracks, otherwise known as ‘Kotoko’ Barracks; Old Site of the Nigerian Defence Academy, Kaduna; Kalanpazi Barracks (Artillery Regiment) and the Nigerian Air Force Base.“The recurring and unending horrific crimes committed in Kaduna under the watch of numerous security agents is indicting for the service chiefs. The attacks also justify the comments of Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Sokoto, Matthew Hassan Kukah, on December 25, 2021 that Katsina-born Buhari from northern Nigeria and his government must move quickly “before Arewa, our beloved Arewa, descends into Arewanistan.”“Indeed, Kaduna and the entire northern Nigeria is becoming another gulag of bloodbath like Afghanistan because Christians are targeted and the worst hit by the killings so far.“The continuous killings in Southern Kaduna must be stopped forthwith. The service chiefs must demonstrate willingness to end the crimes against humanity committed under their nose in Kaduna being a military fortress.“The President must stop condoning, pampering and tolerating the terrorists unleashing these attacks on communities in Southern Kaduna.“El-Rufai should revive efforts for a North-West regional network along the lines of the South-West’s Amotekun for adequate community policing to be achieved as the Nigeria Police Force, the Nigerian Army and other security agents have blatantly failed.”
