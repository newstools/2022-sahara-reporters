Nigerian social media users have called for justice for 22-year-old Oluwabamise Ayanwola who was found dead after boarding a government-owned BRT bus in Lagos. Tweeps are calling out the governor of the state, Babajide Sanwo-Olu and the Lagos Bus Services Limited over their perceived silence despite the series of evidence to show that Bamise had boarded a public bus. The young woman went missing on February 26, 2022, after she boarded a BRT with number 240257 heading to Oshodi at about 7:30 pm to see her sister-in-law, who was said to be in labour.The fashion designer was said to have become suspicious when the driver of the bus told her to sit at the back despite being the only one in the vehicle.She was later declared missing by her relations. The bus was driven by Nice Andrew Omininikoron, who has now been arrested by the police. On Monday, Bamise was found dead. This was confirmed by a relative of the victim. “We are at the morgue. We have confirmed the corpse. An autopsy will be carried out to confirm if any part of her body is missing,” he said.Meanwhile, the Lagos State Police Command confirmed that Omininikoron had been arrested. However, the saddening plots in the story have attracted the outrage of Nigerians on social media, some of whom have planned a protest for Tuesday, March 8 at the Lagos State Secretariat, Alausa and the BRT terminals in the state. According to them, Omininikoron's arrest is not enough. He must be brought to justice, they insist. The reactions are as follows:https://twitter.com/SavvyRinu/status/1500781402949828610?t=hTW4gqfZTTnWb8FelF89Ow&s=19https://twitter.com/ToyosiGodwin/status/1500799681491779591?t=Av9qffZw1ioqo_TBLIsXcw&s=19https://twitter.com/VictorIsrael_/status/1500761485798162433?t=E5uMF0vDosEQT1Q3w95ZOw&s=19https://twitter.com/BhadmusAkeem/status/1500783842218676227?t=qHgcyT_akjLedy43zERCow&s=19https://twitter.com/mrmacaronii/status/1500795410310479873?t=kRzAWsoXL6iiXvx-0fXxpg&s=19https://twitter.com/Allezamani/status/1500771336817364995?t=OnvNupSnWaWXsEN5GFIOxw&s=19https://twitter.com/Tunnykvng/status/1500814949081403392?t=rjVGA3eQdDJoh49UX_ZZ2A&s=19https://twitter.com/MEstyfrosh/status/1500786013895110657?t=QG3GnLTab2DUgUfOsk3q-g&s=19https://twitter.com/EduEle5/status/1500789271636193286?t=xZdijV-EVsusGyl9txAbRQ&s=19https://twitter.com/Safemoon_naija/status/1500774606675881988?t=dJTMuoRGpem6InbNvTJFmg&s=19https://twitter.com/novieverest/status/1500793629769703424?t=Zk62jb-WfJVjjBfSH9uUhw&s=19https://twitter.com/peaceactivist54/status/1500836949124333574?t=IhhtTw73oXH3DG5_Wu6ewQ&s=19https://twitter.com/iseoluwarachy/status/1500836871101894657?t=9id47lofr2RMxT33Eic-sA&s=19https://twitter.com/IamSamzyPR/status/1500811975877705732?t=p6L16Dkk0rEzMwNhNlE8Hg&s=19https://twitter.com/abayomidaramol1/status/1500836833860722693?t=MgPmoNEIAEpHK24rSvet-w&s=19https://twitter.com/tibugzy/status/1500803325146640387?t=ANdNktyBX5lyu3ZWw92sDA&s=19https://twitter.com/KoladeOA/status/1500836266635669508?t=-IHGuZdXVh8IPZF6eUH8UQ&s=19https://twitter.com/babajideoyewoga/status/1500836130010316805?t=Y-cketCHeLHLWelsCty8Rg&s=19https://twitter.com/SamsonOgundipe_/status/1500835889831886853?t=uNZo75R7BK50K0fsex54DA&s=19https://twitter.com/samuelnseabasi/status/1500835763516280834?t=VRA9cDk0DlaCfU8o86l0NQ&s=19
