The United Arab Emirates says it has sent 30 tons of emergency medical supplies and other emergency aid to Ukraine to assist civilians.More than 1.5million people have fled across Ukraine’s borders in over a week of attacks from air, land and sea, according to the UN. According to the UAE’s ambassador to Ukraine, Salem A. Al-Kaabi, the emirates aircraft landed in Lublin, Poland, and the medical and relief aid were handed over to the Ukrainian authorities in Poland to be transported to Ukraine.The statement said the step was in response to the international humanitarian appeal to support displaced Ukrainians and refugees in neighbouring countries.“Sending an aircraft with medical supplies and relief aid is part of the UAE’s steadfast commitment to essential humanitarian needs in conflicts involving civilians,” the statement read.The United Nations said Sunday there were so far more than 1.5million refugees displaced by the war in Ukraine.The UAE last month abstained from a UN Security Council draft resolution condemning Russia’s invasion, but then joined a vote to condemn the attack in the UN General Assembly.The wealthy Gulf state hosts US troops and has been a strategic partner to Washington for decades, but its economic and political ties with Russia are growing.The UAE has also contributed 18.36 dirhams ($5million) to UN appeals for the refugees, the statement said.
