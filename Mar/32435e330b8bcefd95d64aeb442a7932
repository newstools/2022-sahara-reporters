Armed policemen attached to the main gate of Inspector-General of Police Intelligence Response Team (IRT) located at Guzape, Abuja have attacked human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore and his lawyers. This occurred on Monday when Sowore reported to police after the Force claimed he had jumped bail. Omoyele Sowore Sowore who arrived the facility at about 12:30 pm was accompanied by his lawyer, Pelumi Olajengbesi and other activists in solidarity. However, they were attacked and assaulted by armed policemen stationed at the gate. The activist had announced on social media that he would be heading to the defunct police Special Anti-Robbery Squad unit to see its Commander so as to obtain the charges which they claimed were filed against him by a former member of the House of Representatives, Ned Nwoko. The activists who were singing solidarity songs while approaching the gate were violently stopped as they engaged Sowore in a shouting match, asking him to ask his lawyers and supporters to go back. But when the activist was about to explain to them that he was there to make himself available to the police to prove that he had not jumped bail and not on the run as claimed, the policemen assaulted him. They dragged Sowore inside the facility and beat up other activists with him. Some of the activists were also arrested in the process. The police also attacked some lawyers and journalists who were trying to film the scene. The situation also led to sporadic shooting by the police in the area, as they tried to forcibly disperse the crowd. Deji Adeyanju was also among the activists who accompanied Sowore to the police station. He was also manhandled. As at time of filing this report, Sowore has been taken into the facility.
