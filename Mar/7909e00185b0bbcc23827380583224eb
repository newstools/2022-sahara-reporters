The judgment in suit seeking for the declaration of the seat of Rep Yakubu Dogara vacant on account of his defection to the All Progressives Congress (APC) has been fixed for April 11, by a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja. Justice Donatus Okorowo, who fixed the date, said though the judgment was earlier scheduled for today, it was not ready.  A Federal High Court in Abuja had in January fixed March 23, 2022 for the judgment in a suit challenging the defection of the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, from the Peoples Democratic Party to the All Progressives Congress. Dogara who is currently representing Bogoro/Dass/Tafawa Balewa Federal Constituency of Bauchi State in the House of Representatives had on July 24, 2020 defected to the ruling APC citing anomalies in the PDP leadership, particularly in his state, Bauchi. A non-governmental organisation, United Global Resolve for Peace Organisation who is also the plaintiff had in a suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/883/2020, prayed the court to declare vacant the seat of the Dogara at the House of the Representatives, and order the Independent National Electoral Commission to conduct a bye-election to fill the vacant seat. Defendants in the suit are; the former Speaker (1), Peoples Democratic Party (2), All Progressive Congress (3), Speaker of the House of Representatives (4), Independent National Electoral Commission (5); and the Attorney-General of the Federation (6).
