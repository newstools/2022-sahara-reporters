The indigenous of People of Biafra (IPOB) has warned the Nigerian legislators to step down the Water Resources Bill submitted to them by President Muhammadu Buhari to avoid creating a catastrophe in the country.SaharaReporters had reported that Buhari resubmitted the Water Resources Bill to the National Assembly for passage into law to empower the federal government to have control over waterways and sources of water including boreholes, rivers, dams, ponds, streams across the country. The bill has been rejected by the legislators several times as many civil society organisations and Nigerians have repeatedly condemned and rejected the bill with the reason that the Buhari government wants to use the bill to override the state governments’ control over water sources and enable certain groups of people to have unhindered access to water sources.Reacting to the reintroduction of the bill to the National Assembly, IPOB warned that if the legislators go ahead and pass the bill into law in favour of Buhari and “his Fulani kinsmen,” it will lead to a catastrophe in the land.The group gave the warning on Saturday in a statement by its Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful.IPOB in the statement made available to SaharaReporters said, “We the global movement and family of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) wish to call for caution once again over the waterways secret bill sent to the Nigerian National Assembly by Buhari and his Fulani kinsmen.“We wish to unequivocally state our stand once again to Buhari, the National Assembly, Fulani and entire world that Buhari cannot use crooked means to hand over our waterways in Biafraland to Fulani from Futajalon having passed through mighty expanse of empty land in the North, we never for once in our lifetime ventured into encroachment nor occupation of any inch or parcel of land not belonging to us despite our limited landspace.“The National Assembly must save Fulani because this bill sent by Buhari will consume so many of them if they venture into any river or waterway situated in Biafraland.“The National Assembly must stop that bill because it will only end up in the dustbin of history as one of the useless non implementable acts of the Nigerian National Assembly. This deliberate attempt to steal our ancestral land and waterways by trick and through the back door is dead on arrival because it will be resisted with everything that we have at our disposal. Such impunity and selfishness considering the vast expanse of land available to Fulani in Northern Nigeria.“Biafrans would not shy away from protecting our heritage. We are waiting for them and they will learn unforgettable lessons the hard way.“This old strategy that Buhari and his kinsmen are adopting to re-introduce RUGA is not lost on us Biafrans or lost on any other Nation imprisoned in the hell of a country that is worth its name.”IPOB questioned “Why must Fulanis' terrorists and their cows be forced on us, to cohabit with us in our communities?” saying that “those with whom we never share a single value system.”“Let us tell you, Ruga can never sail through for the sake of Umuchineke and no amount of their efforts would succeed in bringing RUGA evil project to fruition in our land.“IPOB will never accept such permutations no matter the inducement they use to deceive the gullible, the compromised, the spineless good for nothing politicians and slaves of the uncircumcised Fulani in Biafraland.”
