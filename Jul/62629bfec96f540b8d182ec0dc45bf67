A clash between some bandits and a splinter Boko Haram sect, the Ansaru terror group, has led to the death of three people. The incident occurred on Thursday in the Safana Local Government Area of Katsina State.  The bandits, led by one Bauche were said to have stormed Damari Forest in the local government area and opened fire on the terrorists. The clash between the two terror groups which lasted for several hours led to the death of three persons including an Ansaru sect top commander identified as Bawa. The incident comes a few days after bandits attacked members of Ansaru in the Birnin-Gwari Local Government Area of Kaduna State. The clash left two locals dead. Katsina, despite being the home state of President Muhammadu Buhari, has witnessed sporadic attacks by bandits and kidnappers that have claimed the lives of many. Over 2,000 people have been reportedly killed by the gunmen in Jibia, Kankara, Dutsinma, Musawa, Danmusa and Safana local government areas of the state in the last one year.
