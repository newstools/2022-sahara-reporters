 The youth wing of South-East socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, has reacted to the alleged killing of seven wedding guests by Ebube-Agu security outfit in Imo State.It was reported on Sunday that Ebube-Agu, a state security outfit opened fire and killed seven youths when they were returning to their community in Otulu, Oru East Local Government Area of the State from Awomama in the neighbouring Oru West LGA. Hope Uzodinma The incident was confirmed by the President General of Otulu community, Nnamdi Agbor and the Imo State Police Command.However, the National President of OYC, Mazi Okwu Nnabuike on Tuesday said he was saddened that the lives of promising young men were cut short by reckless Ebube Agu security operatives.The group lamented on the grave silence of the Imo State Government days after that brutal killing.Nnabuike alleged that in Ebonyi State, there had been reported cases of the use of Ebube Agu by the state forces to settle scores.He said, “Our hearts are filled with rage over this mindless and reckless killing of innocent people by Ebube-Agu security operatives. It is inconceivable that a local security outfit could just open fire on armed civilians for no clear reason. We are even sadder owing to the grave silence of the Imo State Government days after that brutal killing.“Ndigbo are very concerned that nothing good has ever come out of the government of Hope Uzodinma ever since he came to power. It has been one form of crisis or the other and now this strange action by the government-controlled Ebube Agu. His reign has only brought sorrow to the people of the state.“In Ebonyi State, there have been reported cases of the use of Ebube Agu by State forces to settle scores; now, the onslaught appears to have spread to Imo State. This is totally unacceptable and should be condemned by all men of goodwill.“We demand for a private enquiry over this matter and though no life could be paid for, adequate compensation must be made to the families of the victims,” Okwu declared.“The continuous virulent unprovoked attack on the residents of Isi-Uzo Local Government Area of Enugu State by Fulani herdsmen can no longer be condoned.“We find it hard to understand why the security agencies cannot put an end to this mayhem, which has led to the loss of several lives.“The Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide, therefore, calls on Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi’s administration to find an immediate end to this carnage. The primary purpose of the government is to provide security to the people.“The time has come for the government to take decisive action and restore normalcy to the troubled Isi-Uzo Council Area.“We are also urging the people of the Area to begin to explore measures of defending themselves because Ndigbo are not known to the cowards,” he added.
