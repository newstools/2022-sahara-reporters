A Federal High Court in Abuja on Wednesday approved former Imo State Governor, Rochas Okorocha's request to travel to the United Kingdom for “medical attention.”This was stated by Justice Inyang Eden Ekwo, who ordered the Registrar of the court to release the travelling passport of the former governor to him to undertake the medical trip after a motion application. The judge also adjourned the trial to November 7.Okorocha’s application was argued by a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Mr Ola Olanipekun, notifying the court that his client had been having health challenges in recent times.The Senior Advocate contended that Okorocha, now a Senator representing Imo North in the Senate, would not abuse the order and would return to the country for his trial.Although counsel to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Chile Okoroma, appealed to the court to decline the request, Justice Ekwo explained that the request would be granted under strict conditions by the court that Okorocha would return the passport to the court registrar not later than three days after his arrival in the country.The judge held that he would declare Okorocha wanted if he attempted to abuse the favour granted him.Justice Ekwo subsequently fixed November 7 for his trial in the money laundering criminal charges brought against him by the Federal Government.SaharaReporters had reported that that the former Imo governor was under trial for alleged money laundering during his time in office.Others defendants in the suit are; Anyim Chinenye, Naphtali International Limited, Perfect Finish Multi Projects Limited, Consolid Projects Consulting Limited, Pramif International Limited, and Legend World Concepts Limited as 2nd to 7th defendants respectively.
