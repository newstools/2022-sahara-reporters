The General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, has “cursed” kidnappers, herdsmen and other criminal groups terrorising Nigeria. During his sermon at the ongoing July Holy Communion Service, Adeboye prayed that terrorists and all their sponsors would not know peace.  He said he was surprised when he heard the news that some people ordered churches to be shut down for three months adding that they have all overstepped their boundaries. In his words: “As the Lord lives, every evil plot against the church of the Lord will be consumed by fire in the name of Jesus. From now every kidnapper, terrorists including their sponsors will never experience rest again. “From now on in the name that is above every other name, every kidnapper, every terrorist, all their supporters will never be able to rest again. “The blood running in their vein will turn to fire, the air they breathe will turn to fire, the ground they step will turn to fire, the bed they sleep upon will turn to fire, when they wake up, they will be waking in fire, when they sleep, they will be dreaming fire. ”As long as Jesus lives, as long as the name of God I serve is the consuming fire, every evil plot against the church of God, the fire of God will consume them.”
