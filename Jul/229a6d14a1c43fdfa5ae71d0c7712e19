A yet-to-be-confirmed number of soldiers has been killed and several others missing after an ambush by militants from the Islamic State-backed faction of Boko Haram, the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), formerly known as Jamā'at Ahl as-Sunnah lid-Da'wah wa'l-Jihād in Borno State.  Multiple military sources told SaharaReporters that the attack took place in the Gubio Local Government Area of the state on Monday.  The sources added that at least a military vehicle, several weapons and ammunition were stolen and burnt by the terrorists during the attack.  SaharaReporters gathered that the soldiers were on patrol to clear some Boko Haram terrorists in the area following credible intelligence when they were ambushed by the group.  The terrorist group in a statement sighted by SaharaReporters on Tuesday confirmed the ambush.
