  A former senator representing Kaduna Central, Shehu Sani has knocked the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) for warning the British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Catriona Laing against visiting the South-East region.  IPOB had in a statement on Thursday, warned Laing to be wary of the security situation in the South-East, noting that the advice followed an alleged plot to harm her by those “threatened by the Biafra restoration project.”  In the statement issued by its Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, IPOB advised those planning to invite Liang to provide her with adequate security.  The separatist group had said, "We wish to advise the British High Commissioner, Catriona Laing, to be more conscious of her environment.  “We as well call on her to shelve her regular visits to different parts of the Nigerian countryside, especially the Biafraland otherwise referred to as Southeast.  “The reason for this sincere security advice is to save her life… We have optimal respect and value for the sanctity of life, especially for visitors to our land."  However, the President of the Civil Rights Congress of Nigeria and former Senator who represented Kaduna Central district between 2015 and 2019 condemned the security threat to the UK High Commissioner.  The Senator, who took to his Twitter handle @ShehuSani, wrote: "If actually the separatist group in the South East has issued threats to the British High Commissioner, Catriona Laing not to visit the South East, then that threat is condemnable; And I believe it doesn’t reflect the views of the people of the region except otherwise Stated".  If actually the separatist group in the South East has issued threats to the British High Commissioner,Catriona Laing not to visit the South East,then that threat is condemnable;And I believe it doesnât reflect the views of the people of the region except otherwise stated.  He also lambasted President Muhammadu Buhari over his proposal for the establishment of African Anti-Corruption Court, querying whether the president had obeyed the judgments of the regional ECOWAS Court.  He said, "The President wants an African Anti-Corruption Court; the question is how many Ecowas Court ruling has the Government respected and obeyed?"
