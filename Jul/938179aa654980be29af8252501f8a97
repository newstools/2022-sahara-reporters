The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP), a civic group, has declared its readiness to sue the President Muhammadu Buhari government to claim damages for Nigerians over the illegal suspension on Twitter in 2021.The group disclosed this on Thursday after the Economic Community of West African States’ Court declared “unlawful” the suspension of Twitter by the Nigerian government. SERAP urged Nigerians who were willing to join the suit to make their interests known."BREAKING: Following the ECOWAS Court judgment today declaring unlawful Buhari's Twitter ban, we're preparing court papers to seek compensation for ALL victims of the ban."Please indicate your interest to join the suit for compensation. You can email: rights@serap-nigeria.org," the group announced.From June 5, 2021 to January 13, 2022, the government of Nigeria officially banned Twitter, which restricted it from operating in the country.The ban occurred after Twitter deleted tweets made by, and temporarily suspended, the Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari, warning the southeastern people of Nigeria, predominantly Igbo people, of a potential repeat of the 1967 Biafran Civil War due to the ongoing insurgency in Southeastern Nigeria.The Nigerian government claimed that the deletion of the president's tweets factored into their decision, but it was ultimately based on "a litany of problems with the social media platform in Nigeria, where misinformation and fake news spread through it have had real world violent consequences", citing the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria's corporate existence.
