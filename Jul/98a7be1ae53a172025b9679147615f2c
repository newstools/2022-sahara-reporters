Abductors of the Abuja-Kaduna train passengers have threatened to start killing the hostages as from Wednesday if their demands are not met.The gunmen issued the threat in an audio that went viral on Tuesday. Terrorists had on March 28 attacked the train around the Kateri-Rijana area of Kaduna, killing several passengers and abducting many.The gunmen had used explosives to blow up the train track forcing the train to stop before shooting indiscriminately at the passengers.In the viral audio, a member of the group was heard threatening to slaughter the victims because the government failed to seek their release.He, however, did not state what the demands were.Confirming the authenticity of the audio, a Kaduna State-based publisher, Tukur Mamu, who has been an intermediary between the group and the government, said the audio was real and the group had fixed Wednesday (today) to carry out the threat.“These people became provoked on Monday after giving us another opportunity. I was crying and pleading with them on audio that since there is a delay from the government, why can’t they discuss with the family members directly to negotiate the victims’ release. So based on the plea, they agreed to negotiate directly with the victims’ families,” he told Daily Trust.“But they said they are giving us till Wednesday that if there is nothing concrete from those that are interested in negotiation, they will start slaughtering some of the victims.”
