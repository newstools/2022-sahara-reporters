Gunmen suspected to be terrorists have killed 16 persons in the Dangulbi community, Maru Local Government Area of Zamfara State. Dangulbi is about 100km away from Gusau, the Zamfara state capital. File photo used to illustrate story. The deceased persons were killed by the gunmen said to be loyal to a notorious bandit kingpin, Damina while working on their farms. The terrorists came to the village on Sunday afternoon and began to shoot at people. Some farmers whose number could not be ascertained at the time of filing this report were also abducted. Deadly attacks have raged across Zamfara state where banditry has thrived. Agrarian communities in the state have long been terrorised by gangs who raid villages, steal cattle and kidnap residents for ransom. In 2019, the state government signed a peace agreement with the gunmen. About 15 brand new Hilux vehicles and cash gifts were also given to leaders of different 'repentant' gangs of bandits by the governor in 2020. But despite all these, communities in the state are still being attacked and residents kidnapped and/or killed.
