Isah Mohammed Ashiru, said those who are still studying the results of the election are doing that in preparation for their PhD programme.

Omipidan, who repeated the statement during the Channels TV ‘Politics Today’ monitored by SaharaReporters said the APC had taken record of the results of the election announced by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the early hours of Sunday.  Omipidan said the party and its incumbent governor would respond to the outcome of the election after studying the results appropriately and consulting with critical stakeholders.  Similarly, the National Chairman of the APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, earlier on Sunday morning said he was not yet aware of the official declaration of the results of the election.  Adamu noted this while featuring on Arise TV Morning Show programme which started at 8:00 am, a few hours after INEC declared Senator Ademola Adeleke of the PDP as the winner and governor-elect in the election.
