The Majority Leader of the Adamawa State House of Assembly and member representing Jada Constituency, Hammantukur Yettusuri, has dumped the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), SaharaReporters can report. Yettusuri, who currently represents Jada Constituency, home of former vice president and PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, officially joined the New Nigeria People's Party (NNPP) on Tuesday at the party's secretariat in Yola, the state capital.  He was immediately initiated into the 'Kwankwasiya movement', the political ideology of NNPP presidential candidate, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso. Speaking on why he left the PDP even when Atiku, who is from his Jada hometown is running for the seat of the president, Yettusuri noted that justice was his driving force. "He said, "I'm in the NNPP to join forces with other good Nigerians to fix the system, it's not about my own or anybody's personal interest. "You see, if a system continues with imposition ideology, the eventual results become implosion. "As for me and my numerous supporters, we will commence activities immediately to ensure NNPP's victory in the 2023 general elections," he assured. He was accordingly awarded the party's automatic ticket to run for Jada/Toungo/Ganye/MayoBelwa federal constituency.
