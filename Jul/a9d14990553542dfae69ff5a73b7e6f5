The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has raised an alarm alleging that there is a plot to assassinate British High Commissioner, Catriona Laing, if she travels to the South-East region of Nigeria.IPOB made the allegation in a statement by its Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful. However, the group did not name any particular person or group hatching the alleged evil plot.IPOB therefore advised the British High Commissioner to be cautious of her environment and minimise her travels around the country, especially to the South-East.IPOB stated that "In view of the recently intercepted Intel by our M-Branch the IPOB Intelligence Unit Department, there is an orchestrated conspiracy to perform a sacrifice big and powerful enough to strengthen the potency of the British hatred against the Igbos and Biafra. Such high profile plan is zeroed towards using a highly placed person capable of making headline news globally as a scapegoat."The leadership of IPOB does hereby advise that Ms Catriona Liang must as a matter of life and death suspend all her planned activities involving travels within Biafran territories."According to the group, "Those that are threatened by Biafra restoration project has perfected evil plans to assassinate Ms Catriona Liang, the British Envoy on Biafra soil as a quick and cogent reason for Britain to disengage their weapons supplies to Ukraine and concentrate same towards Nigeria to be used against Biafrans. Their aim is to quash the agitation for Self Determination and to kill as many Indigenous Biafrans as possible and other residents in Biafra land."IPOB noted that "In spite of Nigeria government's unprovoked attacks, arrest, torture, illegal detentions, rape, killings and forceful disaperance of our family members especially oue youth, IPOB has not changed our peaceful non-violent agitation into armed struggle."It stated that the group had never attacked British persons, citizens, Institutions, investments and properties of any kind, and "We do not have such intention now or in the future notwithstanding being at the receiving end of the British unpleasant attitudes, Igbophobic, Biafraphobic and stringent policies."It warned that "Whosoever plans to invite Catriona Liang to Biafraland must provide adequate security enough to protect her and counter that which was planned in Aso-Rock in a meeting concluded on the 11.07.2022; 21:35hrs in Abuja."
