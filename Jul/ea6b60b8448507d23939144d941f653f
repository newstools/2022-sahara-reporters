A cleric, Primate Elijah Ayodele, the leader of the INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, has described the Presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi and Rabiu Kwankwaso of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), as noisemakers who cannot win presidency in the 2023 general elections.Primate Ayodele said this on Saturday while addressing journalists in his church in Lagos State during the release of his annual prophecies, “Warnings to the Nations,” Daily Post reports. The cleric who had earlier in May said that Obi could not be Nigerian president said, “Peter Obi is a noise maker; he can’t make a single difference. Saying Obi will win the election is zero.“Kwankwaso is also a noise maker; he can’t win the election. Tinubu, Obi, and Atiku can’t restructure Nigeria.”Ayodele went ahead to tell Nigerians that the 2023 general elections wouldn’t solve Nigeria's problems, saying that only restructuring could resolve the country’s problems.He said that “Nigeria will still be having the same problems we are having. The solution to our problem is not the 2023 elections; it will still put us in the same problems, if not worse. 2023 elections will put us where we are with insecurity and the economy. And the solution to our problems is restructuring; we will have freedom the day Nigeria is restructured.”
