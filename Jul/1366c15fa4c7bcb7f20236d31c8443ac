A youth has been allegedly killed by a stray bullet from the South-East security outfit, Ebubeagu at Umuajioma village in the Oguta Local Government Area of Imo State.  It was learnt that the Sunday incident happened when some youths in the area started protesting against the presence of the security outfit in their locality.  The youths were said to have been angered by the alleged killing of 14 wedding guests by the security group last week in Otulu, in the Oru East Local Government Area of the state. Some of them were said to have been killed while returning from a traditional wedding in Awomama, with five others still missing at the time of filing this report.  A community source from Umunganike, which adjoins Umuajioma told Daily Trust that the incident occurred at about 9 am. The source said many youths were protesting against the presence of the Ebubeagu outfit in their locality, shouting, “We don’t want Ebubeagu in our community.”  Officers at the divisional police headquarters at Ogbuide Road were said to have intervened and calmed the situation, according to eyewitnesses.  But the intervention did not stop the youths from hauling stones at the men.  However, the Ebubeagu personnel started shooting in the air to disperse the crowd and a stray bullet was said to have hit one of the youths who died on the spot.
