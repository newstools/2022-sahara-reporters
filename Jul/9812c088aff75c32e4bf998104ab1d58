The Labour Party candidate in the ongoing Osun State gubernatorial election, Yusuf Lasun has appealed to Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to adopt electronic transmission of votes to ensure adequate transparency.The former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives said he was impressed with the massive turnout of Osun residents. "As far as I am concerned people have turned out to vote. If only our votes would be transmitted electronically, I think it would be better," he told SaharaReporters after he cast his vote on Saturday.Across Osun State today, up to 1,955,657 registered voters are expected to exercise their franchise across the 3,763 polling units to elect a new governor for the state in a keen contest.Soldiers, policemen and members of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) have been sighted in strategic locations around the state capital and border towns.The election, which will be contested by 15 political parties, is expected to be a straight duel between the incumbent governor, Gboyega Oyetola of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Senator Ademola Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).Other candidates in the race are; Goke Omigbodun of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and Akin Ogunbiyi of Accord Party.
