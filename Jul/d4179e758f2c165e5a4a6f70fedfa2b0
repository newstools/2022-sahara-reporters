A terror suspect, identified as Suleiman Sidi who recently escaped from the Kuje prison in Abuja has been captured by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA). Last Tuesday, a terrorist group, the Islamic State's West Africa Province (ISWAP), attacked Kuje Correctional Centre (prison) in Abuja, freeing hundreds of inmates including scores of terrorists.  On Friday, the Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS) revealed the names and photos of some of the inmates who escaped from the correctional facility following the attack. One of the suspected terrorists who escaped during the invasion, Hassan Hassan, was recently recaptured in Nasarawa State. Another fugitive, Sidi, was arrested on Monday by the NDLEA at the Area 1 motor park in Abuja while attempting to board a commercial vehicle to Maiduguri, Borno State. This was contained in a statement posted on the Agency’s social media handles signed by the Director, Media & Advocacy, Femi Babafemi. Babafemi said Sidi was caught with wraps of cannabis sativa. The statement reads, "The fleeing terror suspect, Suleiman Sidi, was arrested in the early hours of Monday 11th July at Area 1 motor park, in the Federal Capital Territory while attempting to board a commercial vehicle to Maiduguri, Borno state. When he was searched, three wraps of cannabis sativa were found on him.  "During a preliminary interview, the wanted terror suspect confirmed he was remanded at the Kuje Correctional Centre for terrorism and robbery charges, adding that he was indeed one of the inmates who escaped from the facility last Tuesday.  "While commending the officers and men of the FCT Command of the Agency for the arrest and their vigilance, Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Mohamed Buba Marwa (Retd) has directed that the wanted suspect should be immediately handed over to the Nigerian Correctional Service, NCOS.”
