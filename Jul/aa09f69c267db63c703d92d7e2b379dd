The youth wing of the apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Council (OYC) has alleged that there was a conspiracy involved in the terrorist attack on Kuje Medium Prison in Abuja, the Nigerian capital city. The group alleged that Buhari’s government must be complicit in the terrorist attack considering how the gunmen unleashed terror on the facility for long without being challenged by security agents.

Premium Times SaharaReporters earlier reported how terrorists on Tuesday night attacked the Kuje Correctional Centre where the disgraced 'supercop', Abba Kyari was kept, among other high-profile inmates were held. It was learnt that 10 inmates and an officer of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) were killed while hundreds of inmates were including all the 64 Boko Haram members held in the prison. Reacting to the incident, the Ohanaeze Youth Council in a statement by its National President, Mazi Okwu Nnabuike and the Secretary, Comrade Obinna Achionye, expressed shock over how the terrorists operated the country’s capital city for hours without being challenged by security agents. The group described the attack as a clear indication that bandits have taken control of Nigeria and a “clear case of conspiracy,” adding that “heads must have to roll”. “There should be a panel of enquiries into the recent security breaches in the country,” the group said. It further lamented the laxity in Nigeria’s security system that allowed terrorists to launch such a “daring attack in the Federal Capital Territory for several hours unchallenged”. “Failure of the Federal Government to take decisive action would mean it is complicit. It will leave the citizens with no doubt that the government has handed the country over to jihadists and terrorists.” “Foul play cannot be ruled out into what happened in Kuje prison and this is why we are calling for an independent enquiry,” it added.
