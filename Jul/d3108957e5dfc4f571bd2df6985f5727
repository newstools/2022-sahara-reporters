Delta State Police Command on Monday confirmed the arrest of Apostle Michael Akpor, the founder of Palace of God Bible Church at Uti Street, Effurun in Delta State in connection to the murder.  The cleric was arrested alongside the mobile policemen attached to him for allegedly shooting two persons to death at the Ugbolokpoko Junction in Effurun on Tuesday.  Two tricycle passengers were shot dead while the tricycle rider was injured by a police escort at Ugbolokposo in Effurun, Uvwie Local Government Area of Delta State on Tuesday evening.  A witness, however, explained that the tricycle rider was trying to overtake the VIP convoy when the armed escort of policemen opened fire on the occupants.  In the process, two persons were shot dead while the Keke (tricycle) rider sustained gunshot injuries.  It was gathered that one of the deceased, a ticket collector at Ugbolokposu Junction was identified as Apepe and the other was a meat vendor at Effurun Market simply identified as Charlie. Angry youths and tricycle riders following the incident, in a show of solidarity, stormed the Ebrumede Police Station Tuesday night and threatened to set it on fire.  However, the police during an investigation revealed that the mobile policemen escorting Apostle Michael Akpor were the ones involved in the killing at Ugbolokpoko Junction.  The Delta State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Bright Edafe, who confirmed the development to SaharaReporters said the investigation was still ongoing.
