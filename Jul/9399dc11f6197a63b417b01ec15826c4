The Katsina State Governor, Aminu Masari, has admitted that the All Progressives Congress-led Nigerian government and security agencies have failed Nigerians.  Masari, in an interview with BBC Hausa, said it is the responsibility of the government and security officials to provide adequate security for the lives and property of Nigerians, but they have failed in doing that, the evidence of which is seen in the increasing cases of insecurity in the country. Governor Aminu Masari Masari is the governor of President Muhammadu Buhari’s home state, Katsina and also one of the APC governors in the Northern region of Nigeria, where terrorism and banditry have thrived. His state is among the worst hit by banditry and terrorism  “Security officials and we the government are who the people rely on to protect them, and we have failed in doing so. But if you take a look at the cause of the failure, a lot of security operatives have been killed. Not up to two weeks ago a commissioner of police lost his life; an inspector lost his life; soldiers have been killed; officers have lost their lives in their efforts to tackle insecurity.  “Insecurity has not just affected Katsina state only, it has affected almost every state in Nigeria and also some of our neighbours like Niger, Mali are also battling this issue,” Daily Trust report quoted Masari as saying.  “There has been improvement unlike before, but we haven’t reached where we want to and we are praying to God,” he added.  The governor expressed optimism that Nigeria under President Buhari will overcome and tackle the issue of insecurity before it hands over to the next administration in 2023.
