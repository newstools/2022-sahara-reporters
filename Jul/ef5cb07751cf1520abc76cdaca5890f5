An Abuja-based Publisher and a proxy of a former Chief of Army Staff, Lt Gen Tukur Buratai (retd.), Isah Bello, has sued Peoples Gazette newspaper for allegedly defaming the Ambassador to Benin Republic. The Peoples Gazette had on June 23 reported that the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) raided and recovered items including 50 luxury watches from the residence of Buratai, used by a proxy.  But Bello, in the suit before a Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court, Abuja, claimed the newspaper failed to respond to a letter dated June 28, 2022, seeking to clarify the source of its story. According to him, the failure to respond to the inquiry was a violation of section 4(a) of the Freedom of Information Act 2011 and therefore is wrongful and illegal. Filed by Osuagwu Ugochukwu of St. Francis Xavier Solicitors & Associates (Legal Practitioners & Consultants), the Publisher asked the court to prevail on the defendant to supply the information requested in his letter. Published in the Daily Trust Newspaper of July 18, 2022, the  suit is titled ‘The originating summons pursuant to sections 2(6)& 20 Freedom of Information Act 2011 and under the inherent jurisdiction of this honorable court.’

3 Weeks Ago ‘That the June 28, 2022 letter of the plaintiff requested the following response from the defendant viz: ‘Did you verify the allegations contained in your write-up with ICPC before publishing? This is because the ICPC press release of June 24, 2022 states to the contrary that Buratai owns the house in Wuse II, Abuja or has links with the K Salam Construction Company Nigeria Limited. ‘Did you check with the Corporate Affairs Commission as to who the owners of the K Salam Construction Company Nigeria limited are? And perhaps whether Buratai’s name appears on the company’s directorship? ‘You claimed you called Buratai during the ICPC raid on the Wuse 2 house. At what time and day did you call Ambassador Buratai?  What number did you use in calling him? And which of the Buratai’s lines did you call?’ Describing the suit as laughable and idiotic, a public affairs analyst said, “They’re suing Peoples Gazette for refusing to honour Freedom of Information Action. It is not applicable to PG, they should have directed that to the ICPC (Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission). “Besides, Buratai is using a third party, this is unacceptable in filing a lawsuit, the person has no locus. They are just trying to use it to silence PG.”
