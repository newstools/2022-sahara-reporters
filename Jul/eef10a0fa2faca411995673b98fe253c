A man, whose name is yet to be known, has reportedly set his house ablaze while his family were inside, over a misunderstanding with his wife in Kwara State. The spokesman for the Kwara State Fire Service, Hassan Adekunle confirmed the incident to SaharaReporters on Monday.  He said the man who is a resident of Lekki Phase 1, Eyenkorin Area of Ilorin, Kwara State, set his house on fire while his children were still inside. Adekunle said the state fire service rushed to the scene to put out the fire and save the children who were inside the burning house immediately after they received the report from a man, simply identified as Kola. "The children and the wife are okay. We were able to save them," he told SaharaReporters He continued: “What we learnt was that the man and his wife had a misunderstanding about two years ago before he moved to another house, leaving the wife and children behind. “All attempts to settle the matter by residents fell on deaf ears and the move to also convince him to allow the wife and children to live there since he has another house also failed. “According to the report, the man suddenly appeared on Sunday and sprayed the three-bedroom flat with petrol before setting it ablaze with the children inside, claiming his wife was frustrating him.” He, however, said the man's identity was not known yet as he was still unconscious at the time of filing this report.
