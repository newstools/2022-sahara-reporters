A man in Osun State, Bolu Bamidele, who died after he was allegedly set ablaze by his wife, Ifeoluwa, over allegations of having an extramarital affair has been buried.  Bamidele, popularly known as Teebam, was said to have returned to Osogbo, the capital of Osun State from Cairo, Egypt, to give his wife a nice treat on her birthday. The wife, according to findings, discovered that Bamidele had cheated on her and even had a child outside their union. Ifeoluwa was said to have gone through her husband’s telephone and discovered the messages the deceased allegedly exchanged with another woman on WhatsApp. After confronting him with the information, an argument ensued. The lady was said to have angrily written on her WhatsApp stories that she would be taking drastic action. She had said that her man has “pushed her to the edge” and that people would weep over the two of them before daybreak. Bolu was reportedly set ablaze in his home at Koka village on Sunday, with all his belongings destroyed. He was rushed to the hospital and died days later. The deceased was buried amid tears on Wednesday in Osogbo in the presence of family and loved ones. The spokesperson for the state police command, SP Yemisi Opalola, said the police had declared Ifeoluwa Bamidele wanted.
