The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has raised the alarm that the Department of State Services (DSS) no longer allows its detained leader, Nnamdi Kanu, to spend the approved period of time with his visitors in the facility.IPOB in a statement by its Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, accused the DSS of violating the existing strict orders by Justice Binta Nyako of the Federal High Court on Kanu’s welfare, describing such violation as “deliberate, permanent and insidious psychological torture being committed against Kanu.” The group noted that the DSS action against Kanu is in contravention of United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) and other International Human Rights laws and principles.IPOB said that “There abound obvious and utter disregard by DSS on the existing laws and thereby, consistently flouting the court ruling that Mazi Nnamdi Kanu deserves an interface with fellow humans. Solitary confinement is a torture under UN Law.“Justice Binta made a Court Order that Mazi Nnamdi Kanu should be visited twice a week, Mondays and Thursdays by his lawyers, family members and visitors of his choice. We want to make it known to all and sundry that our leader is now being allowed to see his visitors for only 30 minutes in contravention of the competent court Order that approved 2 hours per visit by his lawyers and family members.”Warning the DSS to observe and obey the court orders, IPOB said, “We want to remind DSS of their required obligations, some of which are to abide by stipulated Court Orders and procedures in handling all matters associated with our leader, Kanu, so as to minimise unforeseen circumstantial consequences should anything goes wrong.“We are making a public call and open invitation to the international community, Amnesty International, embassies, governments, Intersociety and non-governmental organisations including all reputable human rights organisations to monitor the gross violation of all known fundamental human rights of the IPOB leader and other illegally incarcerated IPOB members in Nigeria.“It's no doubt that Biafrans, especially Igbos race and their religious worshippers are racially profiled and discriminated against in Nigeria by DSS. That's is why notorious terrorists and bandits from the North can kill and commits all sorts of crimes and never get arrested but innocent and unarmed Biafrans especially Igbos including old men and women are indiscriminately arrested, tortured, incarcerated and forcefully dispersed without trace by this lawless DSS and their sister security agents.”According to IPOB, the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their Additional Protocols of 8 June 1977 contain a number of provisions that fully prohibits torture and other cruel and inhuman treatment “that DSS mated on Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and other individuals, especially IPOB members.”“If anything goes wrong with Mazi Nnamdi Kanu in Nigeria's DSS solitary confinement or custody they will know that IPOB members are not pushed over, and the consequences will leave for generations.”IPOB called on the global communities to take note of the “atrocities being perpetrated against our leader Mazi Nnamdi KANU by the Nigeria Government and their lawless DSS. Mazi Nnamdi Kanu is being tortured in DSS dungeon because he spends four days in Solitary confinement and allowed only 30minutes to relate with humans on Mondays and Thursdays.“As against the subsisting Court Order that allowed Mazi Nnamdi KANU to stay up to 2 hours with his visitors, DSS no longer allows his visitors to stay with him longer than 30 minutes on each visiting day. How do DSS want Mazi Nnamdi Kanu's lawyers to interact with their clients for 30 minutes over ongoing cases? “The Court approved time has been illegally changed in breach of the Court Order without due process. This flagrant abuse of Court Orders and dehumanization of our Leader is not acceptable and must be stopped going forward.”
