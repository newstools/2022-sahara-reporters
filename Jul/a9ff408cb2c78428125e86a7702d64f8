The running mate of Bola Tinubu, the ruling All Progressives Congress’ presidential candidate, Senator Kashim Shettima, has said the Labour Party’s presidential candidate, Peter Obi, can only be President in Igbo land and not over Nigeria.The former Borno State Governor stated this on Friday, while featuring on a television programme of Channels TV. Shettima, whose nomination as a running mate of the APC presidential candidate, Tinubu, attracted condemnation, made some chieftains of the party to resign.He noted that the LP candidate lacked the requisite experience to rule Nigeria.According to Shettima, Nigeria is too big for the former Anambra State governor to handle.He said, “The presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, has no political base and structure to win the next coming election in 2023. As far as I am concerned, he’s politically structureless (sic) with little or no experience to lead this country.“Presidential position is not for the unprepared, neither is it an all comers affairs. Peter Obi can only become a President in Igbo land but definitely not in Nigeria. Nigeria is too big for him to handle.“He has no leadership ideology nor experience like President Muhammadu Buhari.”
