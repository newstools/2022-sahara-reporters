Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State has told protesting members of the organised labour that he is equally worried about the prolonged strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). Hundreds of protesting workers marched from the Enugu State Labour House, at New Market, Enugu to the Government House, where they tabled their grievances before the governor.  Responding to the demands of the protesters, Ugwuanyi who was represented by the Secretary to the Enugu State Government, Prof. Uchenna Ortuanya, thanked the organised labour for the peaceful manner they conducted the demonstration. "We share in your concern. We have always known that education is the foundation of the society. That's why this government has obtained NUC license for University of Medicine and Applied Sciences, Igba-Ano. We also attracted the Federal Polytechnic, Ohodo to Enugu State to boost access to education. "We urge you to continue to engage with the federal government. We will effectively deliver your message to the President," he said. Earlier in his address, the state chairman of NLC, Comrade Virginus Nwobodo, said the peaceful protest was held in solidarity with their colleagues in ASUU. He accused the All Progressives Congress led-Nigerian Government of paying lip service to the issues concerning education in the country, saying it is "because most of them have the resources to send their children abroad." Nwobodo said, "For every great nation, education is taken seriously. If these children are not well nurtured, the country is doomed. "Every day we hear federal government borrowing trillions and yet it can't meet ASUU demand. "They get involved in white elephant projects that have no bearing on the citizens "We want to see them implement this agreement."
