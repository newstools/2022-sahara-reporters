The Oyo State House of Assembly has affirmed the nomination of Bayo Lawal as the state’s deputy governor after the impeachment of Rauf Olaniyan. SaharaReporters earlier reported that the lawmakers on Monday impeached Olaniyan over allegations of gross misconduct and abuse of power.  Olaniyan’s impeachment followed the state Assembly’s adoption of the report of the seven-man panel constituted by the chief judge to investigate allegations of gross misconduct against the deputy governor at its plenary on Monday. The lawmakers later on Monday affirmed Bayo Lawal as the new deputy governor for the state. Lawal, who is the Chairman of Oyo State Housing Corporation, will be Governor Seyi Makinde’s running mate in the 2023 governorship election. Lawal’s endorsement came at a meeting held at the Oyo Government House, Ibadan, with Makinde and some other chieftains of the Peoples Democratic Party in attendance.
