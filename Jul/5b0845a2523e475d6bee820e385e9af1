The United Nations has projected that world population would reach record eight billion people by November 2022, with India expected to surpass China as the most populous country.SaharaReporters had also reported that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted a gloomy global economy in 2023.The Head of IMF, Kristalina Georgieva, who made the prediction in an interview with Reuters had said that since April 2022, the global economy had “darkened significantly.” “It’s going to be a tough 2022, but maybe even a tougher 2023,” the IMF boss warned.Meanwhile, a UN report released on Monday predicts that the global population could increase to around 8.5billion in 2030, to 9.7billion in 2050 and to 10.4billion in 2100.According to the UN, the world’s population is on the rise in part due to declining mortality, with global life expectancy reaching 72.8 years in 2019, which is almost nine years longer than it was in 1990.At the same time, the organisation said that the pace of the growth was gradually slowing down.The report – titled “World Population Prospects 2022” – also projects that the population will be increasing unequally across the world, with just eight developing countries accounting for more than a half of the anticipated growth.The countries are; the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines and Tanzania.The date of the publication coincided with World Population Day.According to RT report, UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, in his message on the occasion praised humanity's achievements.He however, noted that the eight-billion milestone “is a reminder of our shared responsibility to care for our planet,” adding that the Covid-19 pandemic, the climate crisis, wars and humanitarian disasters had shown that the world is “in peril.”Guterres said that the world is still plagued by vast gender inequality and assaults on women’s rights.“Reaching a global population of eight billion is a numerical landmark, but our focus must always be on people,” he reiterated.
