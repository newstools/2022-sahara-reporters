A viral video has shown the member representing Igueben constituency in the Edo State House of Assembly, Ephraim Aluebhosele, physically assaulting a journalist with Naija Watch, Leftist Aimuaewonso. The assault happened while the journalist was interviewing the lawmaker to find out the action being taken to fix an abandoned road in his constituency.  Aluebhosele, however, got angry during the interview, descending on Aimuaewonso with punches and kicks. SaharaReporters learnt that the journalist sustained varying degrees of injury after the attack and assault by the lawmaker and some of his aides. “You, you’re being sent by someone to malign the government or the member representing the constituency. Be fair in your reporting, don’t do yellow journalism. You are from Benin,” the lawmaker said.He accused the journalist of inciting the public against the government before he and his aides physically assaulted him.“Where are you from in Benin? And so f****** what? They sponsored you to come and fight us. I’m talking to you, you are telling me rubbish. Who are you? Wetin you come do you (What did you come to do)? Who carry you come here (Who brought you here)? Who sent you here,” the lawmaker was heard saying while brutalising and physically assaulting the journalist. Known to be a violent person, Aluebhosele was one of the nine lawmakers who illegally impeached the then Assembly Speaker, Francis Okiye from office. He also moved a motion to nominate the new speaker. In 2019, Aluebhosele caused a stir online after photos of him at the House inauguration wearing shorts went viral.
