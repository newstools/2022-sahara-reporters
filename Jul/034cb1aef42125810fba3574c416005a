The Bauchi State deputy governor, Senator Baba Tela on Saturday threw caution to the wind by beating up and brutalising some travellers in Kari community in the state. Policemen in the deputy governor’s convoy also opened fire on the travellers who were on their way from Bauchi, the state capital to Misau Local Government Area for a wedding.  SaharaReporters learnt that Tela ordered the torture of all occupants of the vehicles for attempting to overtake his convoy.The deputy governor was said to have been begged by one of the security operatives attached to him to pardon the travellers. “We were attacked by the Bauchi deputy governor and his policemen. On Saturday morning, at around 10 am, we were on our way to Misau Local Government for a wedding ceremony. We were in about 7 vehicles. “When we got to Kira, we saw his convoy in front of us; it wasn’t even moving fast. So while trying to overtake the convoy, which we didn’t even know was that of the deputy governor, they opened fire on us.  “They stopped all other cars and started beating us; the deputy governor personally said we should be treated like criminals. They fired tear gas into our eyes and deflated all tyres.“They did not give us any reason for beating us. They intended to handcuff us and leave but some farmers and villagers had to go and meet the deputy governor to beg him. He didn’t answer them until one of his policemen begged him. We were ultimately unable to arrive at our destination due to what happened. “They used the butts of their guns to hit and beat us to a pulp.” When SaharaReporters called the deputy governor for reaction and clarification, he declined to address the issue, saying, “I don’t talk to people on phone, if you want to talk to me, come to my office,” he said. When further asked if maybe his convoy passed through Kira community on Saturday, he angrily ended the call.
