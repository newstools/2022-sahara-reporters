Human rights lawyer and Chairman of the Alliance on Surviving Covid-19 and Beyond (ASCAB), Femi Falana, SAN, has stated that the 2023 general elections may not hold if the current insecurity is not addressed.He asserted that the immediate past Goodluck Jonathan administration was compelled to postpone the 2015 elections because the terrorists were occupying some Local Governments in Borno State at that time. Falan noted that at the moment, the terrorists were occupying many local governments in different states.Falana made this known while speaking on Channels TV on Wednesday.He said, “In 2015, the Goodluck Jonathan administration was compelled to postpone the election because the terrorists were occupying some Local Governments in Borno State.“Right now, the terrorists are occupying places – Local Governments in Zamfara, Katsina, in Borno, and some other places. That’s problematic.“During election, if that continues and you have candidates that might say, these are my catchment areas, so you can’t go on with the election if you cannot secure the country.”Falana had in June asserted that plans by terrorists in Nigeria go beyond the massacre of worshippers at St. Francis Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo State.Falana had in a statement made available to SaharaReporters recounted how members of Boko Haram and the Islamic State's West Africa Province (ISWAP) made several attempts to bomb Lagos State and other places in the South-West but were foiled by security agencies.The human rights lawyer called on the Nigerian government to take more proactive measures, and equip the security agents with necessary superior weapons to ensure the security of Nigerians.
