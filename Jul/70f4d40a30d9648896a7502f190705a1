Governor Hope Uzodinma of Imo State has reacted to the gruesome killing of 14 youths returning home from a traditional marriage in Awo-Omamma by operatives of the state Ebubeagu South-East security outfit. Uzodinma, who confirmed the massacre of the youths said, operatives of the Nigeria secret police, Department of State Services (DSS) carried the killings, while absorbing Ebubeagu Security. Hope Uzodinma SaharaReporters reported that Otulu community protested the gruesome killing of their youths who were attacked without committing any offence. It was reported on Monday that a viral video circulating on social media showed indigenes of the community conveying the bodies of the murdered youths to the market square in wheelbarrows. The locals had accused the Imo State local security outfit, Ebubeagu of wrongfully labelling the deceased youths as bandits and killing them as they were returning home after attending a traditional marriage ceremony in the area on Sunday evening. But Governor Uzodinma while briefing journalists at the Government House, Owerri after the weekly Security Council meeting, said contrary to stories making the rounds, the operation was carried out by men of the DSS who stormed a bandits’ hideout in the community, following what he called, intelligence reports. He said the “government would not succumb to any campaign of calumny or blackmail in the course of fighting insecurity in the state.” He maintained that all the youths killed were criminals, and vowed to sustain the killing of hoodlums.
