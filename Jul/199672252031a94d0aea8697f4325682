The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), has condemned in the strongest terms, what it described as “genocide and ethnic cleansing” by the Nigerian Army in Nko Obubara community in Cross River State.Recall that few days ago, troops of the Nigerian Army drafted from Edor Barracks in Ikom, Cross River State to contain the communal conflict between the people of Nko Community in Yakurr Local Government Area and Onyadama Community in Abi Local Government Area reportedly opened fire on residents, killing at least five persons while many others were reported missing. A former aide to President Muhammadu Buhari, Okoi Obono-Obla, in reaction to the incident, had told the Chief of Army Staff, Faruk Yahaya, to call his men to order, as youths went on rampage over the killing.Reacting to the incident in a statement by its spokesperson, Emma Powerful, IPOB berated the Army Chief’s narrative of the incident, saying he narrated the usual falsehood to the uninformed Nigerians and their international allies.In the statement on Monday, IPOB said, “Having murdered the innocent and helpless Nko Obubara community in cold blood, the army chief went on television to defend the trigger-happy soldiers.“IPOB is raising alarm over these constant killings going on in Biafra territories of the South-East and South-South. The International Community must not turn a blind eyes on these continuous State sponsored killings of Biafrans in their homes because Biafrans will change in an unimaginable way that will affect the whole world.“We call on Human Rights watch, United Nations Human Rights Council, United Nations human rights commission to quick intervene into this ethnic depopulation agenda and all the arms of Human and People's Right to break their silence over the ongoing silent genocide in our land.“The indigenes and the eye witnesses from the affected communities who have lost their love ones to the hands of murderous Nigeria terrorist Army are the only ones who truthfully give account of the incidence not Army professional disinformation propaganda machine.“These Communities should be visited for accurate and truthful account of the atrocities being committed on them by the army for adequate compensation made to the affected families. The governor of Cross Rivers State must ensure that the ethnic cleansing agenda must stop because we are sure he is dancing to the tune of Fulani terrorists government to eliminate his people; shame on you.“Our people must come together and rise up against this injustice and deliberate depopulation agenda by physical murder, displacement of our villagers and indigenous people, destruction of our means of livelihood, cash crops and livestock to ensure that we don't return after being chased away from our land by the Army of occupation.“The Nigerian government and its soldiers are the enemies of our land and people; therefore we must join hands and our voices together to rescue our land and ask them to leave us alone.”SaharaReporters had reported how Nigerian soldiers also opened fire on residents of some communities in Ogbaru and Nnewi South local government areas of Anambra State a few days ago, killing dozens of persons, mostly youths.
