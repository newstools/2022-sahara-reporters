Armed robbers have reportedly attacked a branch of the United Bank for Africa (UBA) at Bank Road, Umuahia in Abia State.The gunmen on Thursday were also said to have shot one person dead. It was not clear whether the victim was a customer or staff of the bank as details of the attack were still sketchy at the time of filing this report.Eyewitnesses told SaharaReporters that the victim was a fruits seller.The victim was said to have been immediately rushed to the Federal Medical Centre, Umuahia.It was not clear if there were other casualties as at the time of filling this report.The attack has forced many shops around the area to close abruptly, according to a resident of the area who identified himself as Kingsley Oka.Oka told SaharaReporters that the entire neighbourhood had been flooded with security agents.When contacted on the telephone, the Abia State Police Public Relations Officer, Geoffrey Ogbonna, confirmed the attack but said it was not a case of bank robbery.Ogbonna said, "It wasn't a case of bank robbery attack. What happened was that these were some of the robbers who trailed people coming from the bank (people who go to banks to make withdrawals, the robbers will trail them). They will trail their target to where it will be conducive for them to strike and they will strike."So that was what happened today. Our people who were on patrol in that area were able to intercept the gang and on sighting the police they engaged them on a shootout and they were able to escape abandoning their operational vehicle. The police recovered one AK-47 rifle from them as well as a vehicle and one machete."He also confirmed that one person was shot but said the identity of the victim wasn't yet known."A stray bullet hit at somebody who sells something nearby and even one of our colleagues had a slight touch of the bullet,” he added.
