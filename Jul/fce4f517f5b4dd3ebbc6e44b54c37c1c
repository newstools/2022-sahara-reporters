Operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) have again arrested three men suspected to be agents of the ruling All Progressives Congress for alleged vote-buying in the ongoing gubernatorial elections in Osun State.The agents were nabbed at the polling unit 02, ward 2, Ababa, Ifelodun street, Isale Osun. They were caught with bags of cash as they were “inducing voters” during the electioneering process.One of them was said to have also kept money in his socks.EFCC operatives said they had a covert operation and everything had been documented.There have been widespread reports of vote-buying in the ongoing Osun State governorship election by the ruling APC and the main opposition, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).INEC had warned of strict enforcement of rules against cash inducement of voters while unveiling its partnership with anti-graft agencies, including the EFCC and ICPC.According to some observers of the election, in some of the polling units, the APC agents "rewarded" voters with an amount between N5,000 and N10,000 after casting their votes while the PDP gave N4,000 and above to voters after forcing them to swear an oath in confirmation that they voted for the candidate of the party.At Ward 03, Ikija 11, Polling Unit 002, C.A.C Primary School, Ifetedo, Ife-South Local Government Area, an APC agent reportedly gave a "pass" to those who vote for his party as he directed them to a house close to the polling unit to get N5,000.Also, at a polling unit located in Salvation Army Grammar School, Alekuwodo in Osogbo the State capital, voters were seen going into a house three blocks away from the polling unit where money was being shared.According to witnesses, some voters were given N4,000 after showing proof that they voted for the PDP while those who could not show proof of voting for the party were asked to swear before they were given the money.A voter confirmed that they were paid after a woman who claimed to have voted for the PDP was not paid because she refused to swear.The voter who spoke in Yoruba Language said “They asked the woman to swear that she voted for the PDP but she refused to do that, so she was not paid. Those party people are crazy. But our people taught to be doing that.“Before, we used to collect money and vote for the party we wanted but now, they would ask you to swear that it was their party you voted for. Even the APC, before they pay you, they would ask you to vote. PDP people are down there, I had to look for them. I have been paid too. I was paid N4,000.”Similarly, at a junction close to Polling Unit 07, Registration Area 007 in Ilesha East Local Government Area, a young lady confirmed that APC gave voters N10,000 to vote for its candidate.There was also a house close to Ward 03, Ikija 11, PU 002, C.A.C Primary School, Ifetedo, Ife-South LGA where voters go to be paid N5,000 by the APC.
