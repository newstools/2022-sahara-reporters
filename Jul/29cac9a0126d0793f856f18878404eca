The Vice-presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Doyin Okupe, has withdrawn as the running mate to former Anambra State Governor and LP presidential candidate, Peter Obi, ahead of the 2023 general elections. Okupe’s withdrawal is not a surprise having announced earlier in June that he was a “placeholder” in the VP’s slot.  According to Okupe on Thursday, a replacement will be announced “shortly” by Barrister Julius Abure, the National Chairman of the party. “This afternoon I submitted my withdrawal letter from the position of the Vice Presidential candidate of the Labour Party to INEC. “A replacement will be announced by d national chairman of d party shortly. I feel greatly blessed to have been part of the foundation of success 4 the LP,” Okupe wrote on his Twitter handle. Datti Baba Ahmed has been identified as a possible running mate to Obi. He is the founder of Baze University Abuja. SaharaReporters had on June 17 reported that Okupe, the former Special Assistant on Media and Publicity to former President Olusegun Obasanjo, said he was “standing in” for the running mate to Obi. In an interview with Channels TV, he had said, “I’m standing in as the vice-presidential candidate of the party. Labour party has submitted my name as the VP of the party. Our idea is to bring up the largest political coalition ever in the history of Nigeria because we are facing two giants; the APC and the PDP. “We cannot work alone, we need to put up a coalition and it is important for us to ensure all stakeholders are carried along. The choosing of VP candidate is an electoral process which does not stop until the process ends. We believe that the Labour Party coming to rule Nigeria is essentially going to be about young Nigerians. “I’m willing to put down my back so young people can come to the top. The decision of LP to use Okupe is to comply with the Nigerian constitution.”
