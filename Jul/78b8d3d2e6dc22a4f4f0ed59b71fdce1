A former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Babachir Lawal has again described the Muslim-Muslim ticket adopted by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) for the forthcoming presidential election as liable to cause division in Nigeria. Lawal said this on Thursday during an interview with ARISE TV.  SaharaReporters earlier reported that Bola Tinubu, APC presidential candidate, on Sunday announced Kashim Shettima, a former governor of Borno, as his running mate for the 2023 election. The choice of Shettima as Tinubu’s running mate has however generated controversy as they are both Muslims. In the interview, Lawal said the APC cannot say there are no competent Christians in Northern Nigeria who could have been chosen as Tinubu’s running mate. He said, “First of all, nobody should aspire to be president of this country if he knows there will be religious dichotomy in the system. “You will antagonise the Christian majority in this country. It’s a direct attack on them and even in your own zone because when it comes to religion, Nigerians take religion first. “Now, you jeopardise the whole of the Christians in the north, in the south-south, in the south-east. "If it is based on competence, Tinubu, who has one degree in business administration, cannot beat Professor (Vice-President Yemi) Osinbajo. So, competence in what? Who examines this competence? Is it an exam? “So, in any case, maybe given that Shettima is the most competent person from the north, which exam did he take? “Islam preaches justice. Why can’t they see this? No Muslim would want to live in an acrimonious relationship with his neighbour. “See, me, B.D. Lawal, a Christian, APC chieftain, a friend of Bola Tinubu, how will I go to Adamawa and stay on the podium and say vote for Bola and his Muslim-Muslim ticket?”
