The police in the United Kingdom have opened an investigation into Olympics Champion, Mo Farah's revelation that he was trafficked as a child and forced to do house labour.The UK police said it had noted Mo Farah’s claim that he was illegally trafficked into Britain as a child and forced into domestic labour. Mo Farah had revealed in a BBC documentary earlier this week that he was from Somalia and his real name is Hussein Abdi Kahin.He said he was forced to work in domestic servitude after entering the country aged eight or nine."We are aware of reports in the media concerning Sir Mo Farah,” said the Metropolitan Police in a statement on Thursday, July 14.“No reports have been made to the MPS (Metropolitan Police Service) at this time. Specialist officers have opened an investigation and are currently assessing the available information.”Farah says he was helped to obtain UK citizenship by his physical education teacher at school, Alan Watkinson, while still using the assumed name Mohamed Farah given to him by a woman who trafficked him to Britain.Rather than moving to the UK as a refugee from Somalia with his mother and two of his brothers to join his IT consultant father as previously claimed, Farah said he came from Djibouti with a woman he had never met, and then made to look after another family’s children.Mo Farah also claimed that his father was killed in civil unrest in Somalia when he was aged four and his mother, Aisha, and two brothers live in the breakaway state of Somaliland.The British Government on Wednesday assured Farah that he would not be stripped of his citizenship since it was obtained with a false name with a spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson describing him as “a sporting hero.”
