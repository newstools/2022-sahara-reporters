At least 150 intending Muslim pilgrims would not perform this year's Hajj, following alleged diversion of their Hajj fare by an official of the Niger State Pilgrims Welfare Board, SaharaReporters has learnt.SaharaReporters further learnt that the stranded victims who are from the Bida Local Government Area of Niger State, paid their Hajj fare in into the personal account of an Area Pilgrims Officer (APO) in Bida. Sources informed that the stranded pilgrims had resigned to fate, considering that Saudi Arabian authorities might close its airspace anytime soon.Besides just missing the opportunity to travel for the religious duty, the affected 150 persons are also at risk of losing their money.One of the victims, a female intending pilgrim who does not want her name mentioned said she paid the money two years ago. But due to COVID-19 restriction, she could not go. “We participated in the hajj orientation, not knowing that I paid my money into wrong hands. Since I learnt my money had not reached the board, I took ill due to shock. I'm not the only person, we're many from Bida; several others don't even have any idea that they have been duped", she added.The Chairman of Niger State Pilgrims Welfare Board, Umar Maku Lapai, confirmed the receipt of several such complaints from stranded pilgrims, who claimed to have paid money into the account of an official.Lapai, however, said the board could only take responsibility for payments made to its account. Notwithstanding, he said the board had directed the Chairman of Bida Local Government Area to set up a committee to investigate the matter."The board could not take any action until the findings of the committee were out. The suspect has been arrested and report of investigation is expected to be released soon,” Lapai said.
