Motorists and other users of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) popularly called petrol have lamented the high cost of the product in Oleh and Ozoro, headquarters of Isoko South and Isoko North local government areas of Delta State.They have expressed displeasure and concern over what they called "flagrant and illegal" hikes in pump prices of the product by the management of Rain Oil, Okay Oil and Gas, First Guarantee, Ecomag and others.  The motorists and other users of the product expressed their displeasure and concern in interviews with SaharaReporters on Tuesday at their various filling stations in Oleh and Ozoro following the arbitrary hikes in the prices of the product.The prices were hiked from the official pump price of N165 to prices ranging from N170 to N180 in Ozoro and Oleh.Our correspondent observed that the product is being sold for N180 per litre at Okay Oil and Gas, N180 at First Guarantee filling station, N180 at Ecomag filling station and N175 at Rainoil, all in Ozoro while at the NNPC in Ozoro, the product is sold at the official price of N165.At Rain Oil filling station, Oleh, the product is being sold for N175 per litre and the story is the same in Ughelli, Warri and other parts of the state.Some motorists who spoke to SaharaReporters lamented the nefarious activities of the shylock marketers, saying the prices of the product have been arbitrarily hiked even though there doesn’t seem to be scarcity in any part of the state.They, therefore, called on relevant regulatory authorities to as a matter of urgency intervene in the matter, to ensure the product is sold at the official N165 pump price across the state.A motorist who identified himself as Yole, lamented what he called "wicked extortion” and infliction of hardship on the people in the area by the management of those filling stations in the area.Yole said, "How can Rain Oil just wake up and increase the price of petrol to N170 at Ozoro and N175 at Oleh when there is no official hike from the regulatory bodies and no scarcity of the product in Isoko. Go to the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation filling station at Ozoro, they are selling at the official pump price of N165 per litre and the product is available."However, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, speaking with journalists at the end of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting in Abuja on Wednesday, said the petrol scarcity experienced in some parts of the country was caused by marketers.He said, "It is not a supply issue, as you can also confirm. So, it’s not from us. But you know, when you have an arbitrage opportunity, people will tend to take advantage of it.“These are some of the fallouts of the subsidy regime. If you look at it, there are no queues when you leave Abuja, in most places, only in the Abuja metropolis, you continue to have these queues.“So, is it that there is less supply to Abuja than to the rest of the country? It is not so. It is because if you go out of Abuja, they can probably afford to sell at higher prices, and I am sure a lot of you must be buying at higher prices, but within Abuja, because of the watchful eye of the federal government, they cannot sell at those prices.”
