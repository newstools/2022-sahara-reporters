A Federal High Court in Warri has heard the bail application of the Delta State Take-It-Back Coordinator, Ighorhiohwunu Aghogho, who was illegally detained and remanded in prison.SaharaReporters had on June 1 reported that Justice Okon Abang fixed the hearing for July 21, 2022.The lawyers supported by Legal Aid, Citizens Gravel Foundation for Social Justice had filed the bail application for the release of the activist, Aghogho. The case was listed as No 16 on the cause list.Aghogho was represented by four counsel led by U. G Ehirim Esq while the police were represented by S. B. Irabor, a Superintendent of Police.SaharaReporters learnt that in a twist and an attempt to truncate the business of the day, the Zonal head of the Delta State Attorney General's office Warri, one Mrs Aikpokpo-Martins appeared to take over the matter from the police.The judge was, however, bold and refused every attempt by the state to truncate the business of the day.After the arguments were taken, the court raised issues as to whether it had jurisdiction to take the application given as the remand order was made by a magistrate court.The lawyers addressed the court and ruling was adjourned to October, 2022.A source at the court told SaharaReporters that the state government also made desperate attempt to remove Aghogho to an unknown destination in the guise of taking him to Warri for arraignment whereas the reproduction order shown to the warders read Asaba as a destination.“The prison officials resisted this Gestapo moves by the state and Aghogho is safe in custody,” it added.SaharaReporters also learnt that the Take It Back Movement members who visited Aghogho in Prison confirmed that some plain-clothed police officers led by one CSP Fidelis Odunna (O/c Legal of Delta State Police Command) came to pick Aghogho from the Ugwashukwu Correctional Centre.“They came with a tinted Ash color Lexus 350 Jeep and two White hilux vans with well armed men as though they were coming to get a notorious criminal. Nothing on their vehicles or their clothes signified that they were police officers.“When the officers were confronted, they said they wanted to carry Aghogho to Federal High Court, Warri, where he had his day in court. Because of the suspicious manner they appeared, Aghogho demanded to see the reproduction warrant, and what was on it was Chief Magistrate court, Asaba.“Upon this revelation, Aghogho raised alarm in the Correctional center that his life was at risk. At that point, the Deputy Controller Corrections, Ogwashukwu, Sunday Oyachiri, demanded for explanation but the explanation from the officers was not adding up. He resisted all attempts by the officers who were hell bent in whisking Aghogho away without proper explanation and documentation.“When it was obvious that Sunday Oyachiri - DCC Ogwashikwu Correctional Center was hell bent on doing the right thing after several hours, the police left without returning,” a source explained to SaharaReporters.Meanwhile, in the suit numbered FHC/WR/CS/51/2022, the lawyers demanded the release of Aghogho from Ogwashi-Uku Correctional Centre (Prison).The court document read, “Grounds for the Relief(s) sought are (1) On or about the 8th day of June 2022, the Applicant was remanded at Ogwashi-Uku Correctional Centre (Prison) by the Order of P. U. Nsolo (Mrs) of the Magistrate Court 1 sitting at Asaba on the guise of holding charge pursuant to sections 293 and 294 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Law (ACJL) of Delta State. (2) By the said sections of the ACJL, the order made on or about 8/6/2022 has a lifespan of 14 days and was unprofessionally extended to 8/6/2022 by P.U Nsolo (Mrs) on 24/6/2022 without the court sitting.“(3) The Order has expired since on 24/6/2022 and there is no valid order of court extending the remand order since the Court did not sit. (4) That to date, the Delta State Director of Public Prosecution (DPP), Mrs Efe Odogwu Jesin Odogwu has failed to and /or file any charge against the Applicant (Aghogho) if she wishes to prosecute the Applicant.“(5) This Court has the power to release the Applicant on the circumstance on bail pending the DPP advice or prosecution (if any). (6) The applicant is an asthmatic patient and needs to be released so he can properly treat himself. (7) The applicant is innocent of the offence with which he is being accused of and ought to be granted bail unconditionally. The applicant is ready to stand trial at any time if called upon to do so.”On June 6, 2022, the activist was illegally arrested and detained by the police in the state over his calls for a probe into child-trafficking cases in the state.He had also protested against the lack of police vehicles for an investigation involving child trafficking.He specifically accused the Assistant Inspector General, Zone 5 Benin, Lawan Tanko Jimeta of compromising an ongoing child trafficking investigation involving Delta State Government officials, police officers, and a retired chief judge among others.In a petition to the Inspector-General of Police, Baba Usman, the activist alleged that Jimeta tried everything possible to frustrate investigations into the case, urging the IGP to caution the AIG “if he the IGP is not part of the deal as officers in the zone boast about.”
