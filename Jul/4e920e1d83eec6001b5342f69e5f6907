Following the wave of defections in the ruling All Progressives Congress recently, its National Chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, says the party cannot force any member to stay or leave. Adamu, however, boasted that even if people leave the party, it will win the 2023 presidential election. The APC national chairman stated this after visiting Nasarawa State Governor, Abdullahi Sule at the Government House in Lafia.SaharaReporters reports that since last Sunday after the party's presidential candidate Bola Tinubu unveiled Senator Kashim Shettima as his running mate, a fellow Muslim, some party members had resigned their membership. There have been also condemnations across the country, especially by Christians over the party's decision to run a Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket.However, Adamu said while they would not want any member to leave the party, it would not stop anyone.He said, “We don’t want to lose any member but if a member wilfully wants to leave the party without recourse, we can’t force anybody to stay or leave the party.“The issue of defection, there is a season for it in politics particularly in developing countries, and it is not new in Nigeria.“Anybody who is a member of this party is an adult and when an adult takes a decision, it’s either you convince him and if the decision is not favourable to you and he does his bidding, you leave him for God who decides everything.”While boasting of the party's victory despite its Muslim-Muslim ticket in the 2023 presidential election and the internal wrangling, Adamu said it would remain focused.“As for winning elections, we are working to win. By the grace of God, we will win the elections. We are going to work as if it is the last election we are going to handle,” Adamu added.
