Terrorists, locally known as bandits, have taken over the Namoda Shinkafi road in Zamfara State. SaharaReporters learnt that the bandits are currently blocking the highway around Dunwawa community.  Many people were reportedly feared abducted by the gunmen who were said to be attacking the travellers and villagers. This is coming a few hours after bandits attacked Jangebe, in the Talata Mafara Local Government Area of the state. SaharaReporters gathered that the heavily armed bandits invaded the village on Tuesday evening, shooting indiscriminately. Deadly attacks have raged across Zamfara State where bandits have thrived. Agrarian communities in the state have long been terrorised by gangs who raid villages, steal cattle and kidnap residents for ransom. In 2019, the state government signed a peace agreement with the gunmen. About 15 brand new Hilux vehicles and cash gifts were also given to leaders of different “repentant” gangs of bandits by the governor in 2020. But despite these, communities in the state are still being attacked and residents kidnapped and killed.
