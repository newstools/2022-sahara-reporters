The Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, on Thursday said Tuesday’s attack on the Kuje Prison facility by terrorists speaks volumes about the failure of the country’s security architecture.According to Lawan, he was disappointed that there were no Closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera devices at the Kuje medium-security custodial centre in Abuja. Senate President Ahmad Lawan The Senate President, who made this known after touring the facility, queried how a correctional facility of Kuje’s standard did not have any CCTV.He asserted that the Kuje’s lack of facilities meant that other medium security custodial centres across the country lacked facilities.“Having gone round the facility itself, we are disappointed that there are no CCTV, something that will record or at least give you a view of what is happening and sometimes record the event,” Lawan said.“Now this is a medium security custodial centre. How on earth does a centre of this magnitude in the FCT not have any CCTV? It means we can say that all other medium security custodial centres across the country do not have CCTV.“So we have asked the Comptroller-General to ensure that the request for CCTV in all the maximum and medium custodial centres across the country are included in their 2023 budget because this is essentially indispensable.”SaharaReporters had on Tuesday reported that the facility was under attack by gunmen.According to one of the sources, the terrorists invaded the facility around 9:05 pm and operated till 1:30 am on Wednesday morning.He added that over 800 inmates including terrorists escaped during the attack by gunmen.
