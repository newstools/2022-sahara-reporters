A civil society, Yiaga Africa, which is also an election monitoring group, has raised concerns about the “inducement of voters” in Osun State by political parties ahead of Saturday’s governorship election.“Specifically, food items and livestock were distributed to people as a campaign strategy employed by political parties,” said Yiaga Africa executive director, Samson Itodo. Fifteen of the 18 registered political parties fielded candidates for the election and will be on the ballot on Saturday.Addressing reporters in Osogbo, Itodo revealed that voter inducement remained a recurring feature throughout the group’s “Watching The Vote” pre-election observation.“Yiaga Africa is concerned that voter inducement may undermine the legitimacy of electoral outcomes and create an unequal playing field for candidates and parties,” he explained.According to him, violent activities of cult groups recruited by politicians are a threat ahead of Saturday’s election, citing Egbedore, Iwo, Orolu, Ifedayo, Irepodun, and Ede, as flashpoints.“Yiaga Africa tracked the violence attributed to the heightened activities of cult groups in the five pre-election reporting periods. Between July 6 and July 13, Yiaga Africa observers reported intra-cult clashes precipitated by power tussle in various cult groups alleged to be affiliated with the PDP in Gbemu Area/Isale Osun in Osogbo LGA,” he disclosed.“Furthermore, Yiaga Africa received reports of cult groups assembling small arms and light weapons ahead of the election.”“In Ilesa East and Ilesa West LGAs, the cult group known as Afiri Enibaa Boys were reported to be demanding pay-outs from the APC & PDP and threatening to disrupt the conduct of the elections in these LGAs,” Itodo stressed.YIAGA Africa’s director of programme, Cynthia Mbamalu, expressed dissatisfaction with the absence of a female governorship candidate in the contest.She urged security agencies to display professionalism and neutrality during the poll to prevent violence and secure lives and properties.
