Some Nigerians on Twitter have called out a former presidential aspirant of the ruling All Progressives Congress, Adamu Garba, for alleged blasphemy.Garba had while reacting to the news of fake Bishops attending the unveiling of Kashim Shettima as APC candidate's running mate tweeted an edited photo of him wearing a bishop's cap. Adamu Garba



“Ladies and gentlemen it appears I have a new title,” he said in a now deleted tweet.The tweet before being deleted was condemned by both Christians and Muslims who accused him of blasphemy.Below are some reactions from Nigeria;  Adamu Garba can post this photoshop, make funny excuses & getaway with it. But when a cartoon was drawn in faraway Denmark, 30 churches were razed, & more than 17 people were killed in Maiduguri. Adamu & Bashir twerk for death for blasphemy. But Christians should just endure? OK! pic.twitter.com/kWcoZZA8BH   Itâs commendable that Adamu Garba took down that senseless tweet. But thatâs not yet enough, he should come out and apologize to the Christian community. Had it been Adamu knows the implication of what he did in Islam, he wouldnât even dream of doing it.   APC members and Adamu Garba mocked the body of Christ without being remorseful about it. The God I serve is a living God and He does His things His own way. When God starts dealing with APC and the evil men in it, we'll all be witnesses to that by His Grace.   30 churches were burned and more than 17 people were k1lled in Maiduguri when Muslims protested because a man in a Denmark drew a cartoon of prophet Muhammad.People like Adamu Garba can make and reshare jokes like this because??? https://t.co/HU2esPcJzV   Adamu Garba's statement when Deborah was lynched in sokoto Vs. His statement when Fake Bishops were employed to mock the Christian faith. Let's be wise! __________Peter Okoye #davidhundeyin APC and BAT Muslim -Muslim APC VP Chemical Musa Lady T #BBNaija imams pic.twitter.com/lKmP3yQvyL   Let us learn to respect each other's believe and religion. I condemn inviting of fake bishops at the unveiling of @OfficialAPCNg Vice Presidential candidate and I condemn what Adamu Garba tweeted. I am really ashamed and disappointed in both APC and @adamugarba   Adamu Garba has made an open mockery of the Christian community. This is blasphemy but we donât know how to burn people like they did to Deborah. pic.twitter.com/Vqz24foEZE   30 churches were burned and more than 17 people were k1lled in Maiduguri when Muslims protested because a man in a Denmark drew a cartoon of prophet Muhammad.People like Adamu Garba can make and reshare jokes like this because??? https://t.co/HU2esPcJzV
