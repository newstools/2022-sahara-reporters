The Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has shared a photo of himself in Turkey, and captioned it, “Thankful for a fine evening,” hours after he was rumoured to have met with the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Tinubu in France. Wike, who lost the presidential ticket of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party to former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar, is said to be having a long battle with his party also after losing the Vice-President’s slot to Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State.  In a Facebook post on Thursday, Joe Igbokwe, an APC chieftain in Lagos, had claimed Wike met with Tinubu, in France. “While they are on social media abusing everybody, Governor Wike goes to France to meet Asiwaju. Abuse, calling names, hate, and bigotry are no strategy. They have hated and abused PMB (President Muhammadu Buhari) since 2015 and now they have transferred the aggression to Asiwaju. We wait and see,” he had written in a now deleted post. Hours after Igbokwe’s post was pulled down, Wike on his Twitter handle simply shared a picture of himself in Turkey with the caption, “Thankful for a fine evening.” Tinubu had earlier left for France after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, on Monday morning. Some hours after Tinubu left the country, Wike released pictures where he was seen vacationing with his Abia counterpart, Okezie Ikpeazu, in Turkey. SaharaReporters on Thursday reported that Atiku’s picking of Okowa had degenerated into an internal crisis in the PDP. One of Wike’s associates and friends, Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State, on Tuesday had said he was still praying and fasting to know if God wanted him to support Atiku or not. SaharaReporters also reported that the former Governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose, made it clear that he was for Southern presidency or nothing, which was an indication that he would not be supporting Atiku for the presidency.
