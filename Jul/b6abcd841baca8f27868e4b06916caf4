Two suspects, Ibikunle Opeyemi, a lady, and Kadiri Jamiu have been arrested over the alleged abduction of Pastor Mapai Samuel, who is in charge of ZOE Family International church, Odo-Eran in Abeokuta Ogun State.The suspects were said to have been arrested on Thursday following a distress call received by policemen at Aregbe divisional headquarters. It was learnt that two men in military camouflage accompanied by a woman had invaded the church while the pastor was preaching at 8pm, dragged him out of the church and taken him away to an unknown destination.The invaders reportedly called to demand a ransom shortly after the cleric was taken away.The Ogun State Police Command spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, during a press briefing in Abeokuta said the Divisional Police Officer at Aregbe Division, CSP Ikechukwu Gabriel, alongside his detectives immediately embarked on a “technical and intelligence-based investigation.”Abimbola asserted that the Gabriel-led team later discovered that the suspects were hiding somewhere around the Adigbe area of Abeokuta.According to Abimbola, the DPO and his men stormed the alleged kidnappers’ hideout, rescued the victim and apprehended two suspects, noting that the two men in military camouflage escaped.“On interrogation, the woman amongst them claimed to have been in a business relationship with the pastor, and that the pastor cheated her in the course of the business which made her contact the three men to kidnap the Pastor to teach him a lesson."The Commissioner of Police, Lanre Bankole, has ordered the immediate transfer of the suspects to the anti-kidnapping unit of the state criminal investigation department for discreet investigation.“The CP also directed that other members of the gang must be arrested, while he praised his men for their quick response to the distress call," Oyeyemi said.
