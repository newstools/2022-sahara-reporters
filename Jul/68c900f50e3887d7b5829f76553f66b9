The European Union (EU) has continued to place more sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.The EU Justice Commissioner, Didier Reynders, said on Tuesday that the EU has frozen Russian assets worth $13.8 billion since the war started on February 24 this year. Reynders told reporters in Prague that “For the moment, we have frozen — coming from oligarchs and other entities — 13.8 billion euros ($13.8 billion), so it’s quite huge.”“But I must say that a very large part of it, more than 12 billion… is coming from five member states,” he added.This is coming ahead of an informal meeting of EU justice ministers held by the Czech Republic, which holds the rotating EU presidency.Reynders refused to name the five countries but said he expected the other members of the 27-member bloc to step up efforts soon.Speaking on the Russian assets frozen, German Finance Minister, Christian Lindner, said that Germany alone has frozen Russian assets worth 4.48 billion euros in mid-June.Meanwhile, Ukrainian Justice Minister, Denys Maliuska, said that the assets should be used to cover compensation for war damages.Maliuska said that “Currently they are protected by sovereign immunity but our understanding is that assets of a state (that) started a war, committed aggression, shall not be protected by sovereign immunity.“We are suffering from economic losses and it does not make sense to cover all those losses with Ukrainian or European taxpayers’ money.”It was reported that an international sanctions task force said that at the end of June, its members, including several EU countries, had blocked $30 billion in assets belonging to Russian oligarchs and officials.The Russian Elites, Proxies and Oligarchs Task Force also said that its members — who also include Britain, Canada, Japan, the US and other allies — had immobilised $300 billion owned by the Russian central bank.Media reports showed that the EU has so far adopted six sanction packages against Russia, including a ban on most Russian oil imports approved in early June.On this background, a total of 98 companies and 1,158 individuals, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, have seen their property frozen and been banned from entering the EU.
