The management of Akwa Ibom airline, Ibom Air, has announced disruption of its flights because of the aviation fuel scarcity.This was made known in a statement released on Friday and signed by its General Manager of Marketing and Communication, Aniekan Essienette. Essienette in the statement made available to SaharaReporters said, “Dear valued customer, this is to bring to your notice that the growing unavailability of aviation fuel has greatly impacted on our operations, leading to flight delays. At this point, it might now result in some flight cancellations.“While this situation is unprecedented and disruptive to our value proposition, we assure you that it is as distressing to us as it is to you.“At Ibom Air, we will continue to do everything in our ability to operate our flight schedule as close to 100% as possible while looking forward to normalcy being restored at the earliest.“Thank you for your patience and understanding.”This is coming a few hours after the Nigerian airlines operators under the aegis of the Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON), announced that there would be major disruptions of flights across Nigeria due to scarcity of aviation.This was made known on Friday in a statement by the spokesperson of AON, Obiora Okonkwo.The warning is sequel to an acute hike in the official pump price of petrol and a threat by the Association of Nigerian Aviation Professionals to shut down airports across the country in a solidarity strike with the Academic Staff Union of Universities.SaharaReporters had only in June reported that the AON raised fears that they would shut down operations due to the high cost of aviation fuel which hit N714 per litre.Allen Onyema, the Vice-President of AON, had stated this while speaking at the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria National Aviation Conference in Abuja.Onyema who is also the chairman of Air Peace had said, “If nothing is done concerning the cost of aviation fuel, the fuel crisis will take away three airlines in Nigeria in a few weeks.”
