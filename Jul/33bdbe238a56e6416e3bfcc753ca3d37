Operatives of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), have confirmed rescuing a girl who was chained and locked up by her mother in a room for eight years in Kaduna State.The NSCDC spokesperson in Kaduna State, DSC Habeeb Badamasi, told SaharaReporters that the operatives of the State command rescued one Hauwa, who was locked up by her own mother for eight years.  Hauwa who now behaves strange, is believed to be suffering from psychiatric complications associated with trauma.The incident reportedly happened in the Lere Local Government Area, according to Badamasi.He said, "Yes I can confirm that we received intelligence from the Kaduna State Ministry of Human Services and Social Development that one Hauwa from Lere was in an illegal detention at a family house."In response we identified the location and found that the victim had been locked up for eight years and we rescued her.”The Kaduna State Commissioner of Human Services and Social Development, Hapsat Baba, also confirmed that the rescued Hauwa had been illegally detained for eight years by her own mother."I was informed of Hauwa's ordeal by one Rukaiya Sani; immediately I reached out to NSCDC and we went and found the situation to be true. For those eight long years, this girl did not see the light of the sun, she ate inside the room, defecated inside the room; in fact, the precarious situation has affected her mental health at the moment."Right now she's at a hospital where she's been rehabilitated; thereafter we'll seek psychiatric care at a tertiary hospital. She was put in this condition by her mother, but that'll not stop us from prosecuting whoever is involved according to the laws of the state,” she said.When contacted, the only brother of the survivor, who simply identified himself as Gaddafi said his sister got into trouble because she was disrespectful to their single mother."Yes, Hauwa is my sister, she was locked up because of her bad manners. She was so disrespectful and would at the slightest provocation insult our mother who is also playing fatherly role over us."That's why I believe God cursed her to suffer this way, because she's mentally deranged,” Gaddafi said.Find below link to video of victim, Hauwa, lucked up for eight years for screen graph
