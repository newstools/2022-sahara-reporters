The Bayelsa State Governor, Senator Douye Diri on Tuesday met with the protesting Nigerian Labour Congress members and university students over the lingering university lecturers’ strike.Diri assured the workers that the government would ensure that the protracted university lecturers' strike was quickly resolved. Among the unions which joined the NLC solidarity protest was the Niger Delta Students Union."We are participating in this National protest that has been organised by the Nigerian Labour Congress in support of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) over the non-implementation of agreement by the FG and to return our children back to school."This ASUU strike has been on for over five months and the Federal Government has failed to proffer solutions and it decided to deprive Nigerian students of their right to education.“As we call now, education is a right and not a privilege and as such we have joined our hands together and spoken up in redeeming our educational sector."We are calling on all security agents to protect all of us who are out here unleashing our grievances and have also promised to be law abiding," the union said in a circular.ASUU has been at loggerheads with the Federal Government since February 14 over the latter’s failure to honour some past agreements, among others.The disagreement has kept students of public universities at home for the past five months.Some other unions in the university system are also on strike due to disagreements with the Federal Government for different reasons.
