The lingering crisis rocking the Delta State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, (PDP), following the party's primaries especially that of the governorship is yet to abate.SaharaReporters learnt that former governors, James Ibori and Emmanuel Uduaghan on Saturday shunned the party's "Mega Rally" held at the Delta State University of Science and Technology, stadium, Ozoro, headquarters of the Isoko North Local Government Area of the state. Also conspicuously absent at the rally were an aggrieved senator representing Delta South senatorial district and former governorship aspirant, James Manager, the state deputy governor and former governorship aspirant, Kingsley Otuaro, former Commissioner for Justice and Attorney General, Peter Mrakpo among other stakeholders of the party. The party in the state has been divided into two camps and engulfed with crisis following the PDP primaries where Okowa was accused to have secretly supported and imposed his preferred candidate on the people across the state.A chieftain of the party in the state who pleaded for anonymity said, “One faction is being led by Governor Ifeanyi Okowa who has thrown his weight behind his anointed governorship candidate and the Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Sheriff Oborevwori and the second faction is being led by the former governor James Ibori whose anointed governorship candidate and former Commissioner for Finance, David Edevbie is being frustrated by Okowa.“Okowa has vowed that over his dead body should Edevbie, his immediate past chief of staff be the governor of the state. The current crisis if not properly handled will consume the party in the 2023 general elections."With what is happening now, the party has no governorship candidate for the 2023 general elections because of cases in court bothering on the discrepancies in academic credentials of the state governorship candidate and speaker of the state house of Assembly, Sheriff.”
