At least 12 persons have reportedly died in a violent clash between bandits and vigilantes in Plateau State, SaharaReporters has learnt.Local sources informed that the bandits stormed Zak, a community in the Wase Local Government Area on a mission to sack the community. They were however resisted by vigilante operatives in the area."The bandits came to our village around 9am on Sunday, and were engaged by battle-ready vigilante men who killed nine of them. Sadly three vigilantes also died in the process,” a local source confirmed. The Spokesperson of Operation Safe Haven (OPSH) in the state, Major Ishaku Takwa, also confirmed the encounter but he could not give the casualty figures.He said, “The troops repelled the attack and moved to the Gajin Bashar community to fight bandits who also stormed the area.”Bandits had initially given quit notices to residents of Zak, Sabon Zama, Gindin Dutse, Anguwan Tsohon Soldier, Anguwan Yuhana and Anguwan Mangu villages of Wase to vacate or face terror attacks.SaharaReporters had on June 30 rpeorted that there was an uneasy calm at Wase Local Government Area following the expiration of a 5-day quit notice served on 10 communities in the council to relocate or face dire consequences by bandits.A resident who spoke to SaharaReporters on condition of anonymity had confirmed that the Islamic terrorists also called “bandits” had visited some of the communities over the weekend to issue the ultimatum.“They also threatened to kill anyone who disobeyed the order,” the source said.He had said that residents of the affected villages and communities since Wednesday started leaving their homes before the deadline elapsed.Efforts made by SaharaReporters to get the reaction of the State Police Command were unsuccessful as the Command's spokesman, DSP Alfred Alabo, could not be reached on the telephone.
