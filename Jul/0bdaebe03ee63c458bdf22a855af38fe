A former Minister of Education, Dr Oby Ezekwesili, has joined numerous Nigerians to express her displeasure on the choice of the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, to pick Senator Kashim Shettima, a fellow Muslim as his running mate for the 2023 elections. Ezekwesili, who took to her Twitter handle to voice her displeasure, said it was “innate dishonesty when people fluctuate their rhetorics just to suit personal interest rather than adopt a strategy for success that shapes an inclusive society.”  SaharaReporters had reported that reactions continued to trail the ruling APC Muslim-Muslim ticket since the former Lagos State Governor announced his fellow former governor of Borno State as a running mate. Some Catholic Bishops and northern Christian communities had also wanted a Christian from the Northern region for the position. In her reaction, the former Minister, notable for the #BringBackOurGirls campaign, tweeted, “When innate dishonesty makes people fluctuate their rhetorics on Inclusion just to suit their personal interests, reasonable minds should never waste time analysing to make sense of the nonsense. Just design a strategy for success that permanently shapes an Inclusive Society. “Those who squandered what remained of Nigeria’s management of our diversity and social capital cannot be expected to care about the sensitivities every reasonable mind knows to be critical in stabilising our fractured polity. “The Siamese twins of bad governance never disappoint. It was a country struggling to become a nation; now it struggles to remain a country. Such failure is hugely not sustainable. I called it “The Unsustainability of Failure” in a speech some years ago.”
