The Nigeria Labour Congress and the Joint Action Committee, comprising the Non-Academic Staff Union of Educational and Allied Institutions and the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities, have said their planned protest in solidarity with the Academic Staff Union of Universities will hold as planned.The labour unions said they were not aware of any security report by the Department of State Services that advised against the rally, insisting that their protest in solidarity with ASUU over its six months old strike would hold on July 26 and 27, PUNCH reports. ASUU had on February 14, 2022 embarked on a nationwide strike over the failure of the Federal Government to honour the agreement it reached with the union in 2009.The issues in contention include the delay in the release of the revitalisation fund for the universities, adoption of the University Transparency and Accountability Solution as the preferred payment platform for the university system and the payment of earned academic allowances to lecturers.Despite the series of meetings between the Federal Government and the union, the issues have yet to be resolved, prolonging the strike and prompting the intervention of the NLC.The Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, on Wednesday, declared the proposed nationwide protest illegal, saying the NLC had no dispute with the government.Also on Thursday, the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, cautioned against the demonstration, saying he received a security report from the DSS that the rally might be hijacked by hoodlums.But responding to Ngige on Friday in an interview with PUNCH, the Head, Information and Public Affairs, NLC, Mr Benson Upah, stated that the congress was not aware of any security report by the DSS.He noted that the rally was a symbolic gesture to pressure the government to resolve the five-month ASUU strike, adding that the union’s rallies were always peaceful and that participants had always conducted themselves in a peaceful manner.He said the police were aware of the protest and would be expected to provide security during the exercise.He said, “First and foremost, none of our rallies have ever been associated with violence; Nigerians can attest to that. We have always been peaceful; we will ensure we are not implicated. We will carry out our duty as usual.“I’m not aware of any directive sent to us but I heard the Minister of Labour and Employment saying an advisory came to him, but this will not be the first time such an advisory will be issued.“Left for the DSS, we will not hold any peaceful rally in this country. At the peak of Boko Haram attacks in Abuja we had our rally. All the rallies were peaceful. I think that is a testimony to our patriotic intention, our organisational capability, our vigilance and the voice of appreciation from Nigerians and we appreciate all of that. We have been able to conduct ourselves reasonably well.”Responding to the statement by the government that the education minister was not given two weeks to resolve the ASUU crisis, Upah argued that this means the government was not interested in a quick resolution of the crisis.He noted, “It’s an open ‘cheque’ such that even if it takes till 2023 there is nothing wrong. So, you see why it is necessary for a rally as a platform for people to speak publicly to the issues at stake.“In a situation like this, what I expect the government to say, given the increasing anxiety, is that the Ministers of Education and that of Labour and Employment are hereby given the mandate to resolve the issues in 48hrs. That would have been more consoling.”
