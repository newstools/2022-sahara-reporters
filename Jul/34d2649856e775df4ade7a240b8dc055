Multiple people were reportedly shot dead as gunfire erupted near a Fourth of July parade in a Chicago suburb in the United States. According to officials, a gunman began firing from the roof of a retail store into the parade below just minutes after the celebrations began.  A viral video on social media shows parade participants suddenly disappearing in panic as gunfire erupted in the streets of Highland Park, an affluent suburban city. Families were seen sitting on a sidewalk watching the parade. In the next frame, they are seen leaping up from the ground and running, and a voice yelling "gunshots" can be heard in the background. The event was immediately cancelled due to this incident. Witnesses told the Chicago Sun Times they saw at least five people lying on the ground in pools of blood and another under a blanket Illinois Rep. Bob Morgan also confirmed via his Twitter handle Monday that he was at the parade and there were multiple injuries. “For those unaware, there was a shooting at the Highland Park Parade. I cancelled because there have been multiple injuries. Please stay out of the area, stay safe, and please pray for those injured”, he wrote. Highland Park Police responded to the shooting incident in downtown Highland Park. “Fourth Fest has been cancelled. Please avoid downtown Highland Park. More information will be shared as it becomes available”, tweeted Nancy Rotering, Mayor of Highland Park. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker also tweeted: “My staff and I are closely monitoring the situation in Highland Park. State police are on the scene and we have made all state resources available to the community. We will continue working with local officials to help those affected.”
