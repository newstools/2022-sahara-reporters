The Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS) has released the names and photographs of some Boko Haram inmates who recently escaped from Kuje Correctional Centre in Abuja, the nation’s capital.The NCoS on Friday released 48 names and pictures Boko Haram terrorists held at the prison facility.  SaharaReporters earlier on Tuesday reported that the facility was under attack by gunmen.  The Islamic State-backed faction of Boko Haram, known as the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) on Wednesday in a video claimed responsibility for the attack.  In the video, the terrorist sect showed some of its men were shooting their way into the facility.  Though the Minister of Defence, Bashir Magashi claimed that 64 Boko Haram members escaped, security sources told SaharaReporters that over 201 members of the group were unaccounted for.  “The prison management and Nigerian government are playing down the numbers of Boko Haram inmates for some reasons.  “Over 200 escaped not 64 as claimed. There were over 150 of them in that facility before, so they brought 46 from Kogi State after the Kanna Jailbreak. They were transferred to Kuje about 5 months back.  “Then another set of Ansaru members arrested by the police from Nasarawa State were taken to Kuje, about 17 of them. They were taken to Kuje around November last year,” a top security source told SaharaReporters.  Giving an update on the attack on Friday, NCoS in a Facebook post said, “PHOTO NEWS: Faces of Boko Haram/ Terrorist that escaped from Kuje Medium Security Custodial Center on Tuesday 5th July at about 2200hrs. Please more pictures of other escapees will be uploaded.”
