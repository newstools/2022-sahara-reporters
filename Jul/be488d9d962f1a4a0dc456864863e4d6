General Overseer of Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye says he never asked Christians to buy guns for self-defence. According to the cleric, Christians can acquire less dangerous weapons for self-defence when they come under attack.  Adeboye, who spoke in a sermon on Sunday, was responding to reactions that trailed an earlier message in which he asked Christians to defend themselves against frequent attacks on churches in Nigeria. At the July Holy Ghost Service, on July 2, he urged members of the church not to be afraid to attend church programmes because of the June 5, 2022 terrorist attack on a church in Owo, Ondo State.

1 Day Ago Some terrorists attacked Saint Francis Catholic Church, Owo, on June 5, killing about 40 worshippers and injuring many others. Adeboye urged Christians to rise to the occasion and call the bluff of the devil. But in his latest sermon on Sunday, the pastor said he did not ask Christians to buy guns. According to NAN, Adeboye noted that they don’t require permission to get the jawbone of a cow. “Don’t buy guns. You don’t want to kill anybody. We just must make sure that unwanted visitors don’t come to our churches, so don’t go and buy guns,’’ he said.
