Suspected terrorists have kidnapped a young lawyer, identified as Shamwilu Abdullahi on his farm at Gidan Ango in the Magami District of Gusau local government area of Zamfara State. SaharaReporters learnt that he was kidnapped last Thursday.  It was gathered that the terrorists have contacted his family and demanded a ransom of N30 million for his release. “But after several negotiations between his father, Sheikh Abdullahi Dalla Dallaglio Gusau and the terrorists, the ransom was reduced to N15 million,” a source close to the family told SaharaReporters. All efforts to get the reaction of the Nigeria Police Force, Zamfara State Command, were unsuccessful. The spokesperson for the state police command, Muhammed Shehu, told SaharaReporters that he would get back but never did. Subsequent efforts to reach him on his mobile phone were not successful as he did not answer the calls and also did not reply to the text message sent to him. Last Sunday, SaharaReporters also reported that gunmen suspected to be terrorists killed 16 persons in the Dangulbi community, Maru Local Government Area of Zamfara State. Dangulbi is about 100km away from Gusau, the Zamfara state capital. The deceased persons were killed by the gunmen said to be loyal to a notorious bandit kingpin, Damina while working on their farms. The terrorists came to the village on Sunday afternoon and began to shoot at people. Some farmers whose number could not be ascertained at the time of filing this report were also abducted. Deadly attacks have raged across Zamfara state where banditry has thrived.
