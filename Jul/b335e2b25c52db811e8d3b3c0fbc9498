The residence of Nathaniel Agunbiade, the Osun State Commissioner for Lands and Physical Planning, has been attacked by thugs who were suspected to be loyalists of the ruling All Progress Congress(APC). SaharaReporters gathered that the hoodlums on Monday morning launched the attack on Agunbiade's house in the Erinmo Ijesa town of the state, vandalised his properties and many of his cars because he failed to pay their delegate fees during the last Saturday governorship election in the state.   It was also reported that several aides of the Commissioner were injured while attempting to resist the attackers. A reliable source confirmed to SaharaReporters that the thugs were members of APC and not that of the opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party as was insinuated in some quarters. "They attacked the commissioner because he failed to settle them for the role they played during the election," the source confirmed.   When SaharaReporters contacted the Osun State Police Command’s spokesperson, Yemisi Opalola, she confirmed the incident. "They truly attacked the commissioner and planned to kill him but Thank God, he escaped. "But when we asked him if he suspected anybody to aid our investigation, he said he did not know them," the police spokesperson told SaharaReporters. SaharaReporters had reported that the Independent National Electoral Commission on Sunday morning declared Ademola Adeleke the Governor-Elect of Osun State after garnering a majority of votes cast in the governorship election in the state. The victory came for Adeleke nearly four years after failing by a small margin in his bid to govern Osun State when he lost to the incumbent governor, Gboyega Oyetola.
