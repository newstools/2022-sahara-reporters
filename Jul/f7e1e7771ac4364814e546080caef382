The management of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) says the establishment of a trust fund for the scheme was meant to address infrastructural deficit.The Senate passed the bill seeking to establish the trust fund in June 2022, while the House of Representatives passed the bill earlier in April 2022. The Trust Fund established under Section 3 of the Act covers all corps members, personnel of the NYSC, orientation camps, formations, and facilities, and it is meant for the overall improvement and efficiency in the discharge of their duties and responsibilities.A staff of the scheme had told SaharaReporters that the action was a grand plot to use the trust fund as a retirement package for top military officers, especially Director Generals who are always appointed from the army.He had described the trust fund as a slush fund for the military, where monies are disbursed to top military officers at the behest of the Chief of Army Staff."The NYSC Trust fund will provide funding for these officers through proxies that would receive monies on their behalf. I can tell you there is excitement within the top echelon of the military, and they have consequently mounted pressure for its speedy passage into law,” the source had said.Reacting, Eddy Megwa, the NYSC Director, Press and Public Relations, said the fund wasn’t meant for retired military officers but to address the infrastructural deficit besetting the scheme in the area of camp renovation and maintenance; upgrading, building and maintenance of corps members’ lodges, among others.The statement read, “The decision to establish NYSC Trust Fund was conceived during a meeting held with some of the Scheme's stakeholders; notably: the thirty-six State Governments and FCT Administration; and thereafter strongly supported by civil societies, National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) as well as Association of Local Governments of Nigeria (ALGON).“Primarily, the Fund is purposed to address the infrastructural deficit besetting the Scheme in the area of camp renovation and maintenance; upgrading, building and maintenance of Corps Members' Lodges, among others.“Statutorily, the Scheme as it were, has a tripartite funding arrangement - the Federal, State and Local Governments, with each having varying degree of responsibilities.“Over the years, the Scheme has equally partnered governmental and non-governmental institutions in the area of providing start-up capitals to Corps Members to fund their business initiatives under the NYSC Skill Acquisition and Entrepreneurship Development programme which is a direct answer to the often asked rhetorical question: After the NYSC what next?.“The Trust Fund will provide funds to a greater percentage of Corps Members trained under the NYSC Skill Acquisition programme to start-up their businesses.“It is appropriate to clarify that the Fund which passed public hearing, with civil societies, the academia, among others, fully represented is not a pool of slush fund meant to gratify the financial cravings of top military officers as erroneously stated by the writer of the story.“While Management holds the media in high esteem as a worthy partner, it wishes to restate the need for writers to clarify issues pertaining to the Scheme with the managers before rushing to publish, in order to guard against misleading the public.”
