Several persons have been injured after suspected thugs invaded the venue of a meeting of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) youths in Ologba, Dekina Local Government Area of Kogi State.  According to eyewitness accounts, guns, knives, clubs, horns and other dangerous weapons were used by the invading thugs during the attack.  Though details of the incident are still sketchy, SaharaReporters learnt that the hoodlums also burnt several vehicles and motorcycles belonging to some PDP members.  The house of the opposition party’s youth leader in Iyale was also set ablaze.  “There is serious tension in Dekina LGA now. The thugs came to the PDP youth meeting venue yesterday (Sunday) at Ologba, destroyed properties, burnt vehicles and motorcycles,” one of the sources told SaharaReporters on Monday.  In November 2019, the PDP woman leader in Ochadamu Ward, Ofu Local Government Area, Mrs Acheju Abuh was killed by suspected political thugs, who burnt her alive in her home.  The prominent politician was sleeping in her home when political thugs set the building alight.
