A human rights lawyer and activist, Chief Malcolm Omirhobo, has submitted a petition against Muslim group, the Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) to the office of the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba.SaharaReporters earlier reported that MURIC knocked Omirhobo, a Nigerian lawyer who appeared in courts in a traditional priest’s attire. MURIC had told Malcolm to withdraw suits against hijab use, arabic writing on naira notes and the Nigerian Army logo.Meanwhile, the lawyer said MURIC's statement had incited Muslims against his person and exposed him to ridicule and hatred in the Muslim society.He therefore urged the Nigerian police to investigate the matter and take necessary steps against MURIC.He said, "On 23rd June, 2022, in exercise of my fundamental right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion I appeared in the supreme court of Nigeria adorning my Igbe spiritual attire on my Lawyer's uniform which perchance caught the attention of the press and went viral globally."In reaction to my attire, MURIC, through its founder and Chairman of its board of trustees, Prof Ishaq Akintola, deliberately assassinated my character by causing the wild dissemination of the following criminal libellous statement against me.MURIC had said, "Going by his personal record, we are not in any way taken aback. by what Omirhobo did yesterday. The lawyer has exhibited pathological hatred for Muslims, their religion and the language of their faith in the past."Was it not the same Omirhobo who went to court over the existence of Arabic letters on naira notes? He did not stop there. He challenged the use of Arabic on army logo. He also sued the Nigerian Police for approving hijab for police women in Nigeria.”Meanwhile, the human rights lawyer in the petition, obtained by SaharaReporters on Friday, said, “The above libellous statements against my person was in a publication titled "Islamic group react as lawyer, Omirhobo dresses like juju priest to supreme court" published by John Owen Nwachukwu in the Daily Post Newspaper and other National dallies."The said publication which is awash in the social media is false, malicious and calculated to defame me and did defame me. That the aforesaid publication lowered me in the estimation of right thinking members of the Muslim society and exposed me to hatred, ridicule, odium, scorn, contempt and unlawful violent."Consequent upon the above, I am making this petition to your office to investigate the matter and take necessary steps against MURIC," he added.
