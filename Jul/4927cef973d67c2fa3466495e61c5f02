The Federal High Court sitting in Damaturu, Yobe State has granted an order of substituted service of court processes on the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan over the All Progressives Congress primary election held in Yobe North Senatorial District.  Bashir Machina, the winner of the Yobe North senatorial district’s primary election, had in a suit filed on June 22, 2022, asked the Court to declare him as the authentic senatorial candidate of the APC for Yobe North and order the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to recognise him as such.  But when the case came up on Thursday, the presiding judge, Fadimatu Mohammed, granted the application after one of the lead counsels for Machina, Nureini Jimoh (SAN), moved the application that since the case was filed in the Court on June 22, 2022, the bailiffs had found it difficult to serve the writ of summons to the Senate President, who is the second defendant in the case.  The case was adjourned to August 15, 2022, to ensure that parties have been properly served.  Machina had won the ticket after polling 289 votes in the primary election which was duly observed by officials of the INEC and security agencies.  He has been at loggerheads with the Senate President, Lawan, following the latter’s attempt to claim the ticket after losing his bid for the party’s presidential slot.  SaharaReporters earlier reported that the APC had submitted Lawan’s name as the candidate for the Yobe North Senatorial District zone for 2023, prompting Machina to seek legal redress.
