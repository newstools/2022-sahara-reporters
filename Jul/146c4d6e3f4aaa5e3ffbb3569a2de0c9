Over 603 inmates are still missing seven days after terrorists attacked Kuje Correctional Centre in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital. Gunmen suspected last Tuesday night attacked the prison facility, leaving the facility heavily damaged by the firepower brought by the assailants.  Multiple sources told SaharaReporters that the gunmen invaded the facility around 10 pm. The Islamic State-backed faction of Boko Haram, known as the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) in a video last Wednesday claimed responsibility for the attack. In the video, the terrorists are seen shooting their way into the facility. The Nigerian government said 879 inmates escaped from the facility during the unfortunate attack.
