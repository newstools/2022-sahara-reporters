A Lagos-based business mogul, Biola Osundiya was shot dead last Wednesday in Ilorin, Kwara State by yet-to-be-identified gunmen. SaharaReporters gathered that Osundiya was in Ilorin to spend time with his family and during one of his outings within the metropolis, he was trailed and killed by the suspected gunmen at a drinking joint beside the Kwara State Centre for Art and Culture.  One of his relatives who spoke to SaharaReporters on the issue said the deceased was killed by some of his business rivals. "From what we have been gathering, those that killed him were his business rivals," the source confirmed. Similarly, one of his brothers, simply identified as Segun, said the development had left his family and friends devastated. He begged the security agencies to bring the culprit to justice. Meanwhile, the Police Public Relations Officer, Kwara Command, Ajayi Okasanmi, confirmed that the police were still investigating the matter and assured killers will be brought to justice. “We can’t say for now whether the killing was by cultists or business-related, but an AK- 47 ammunition was recovered from the scene and we are working to establish those behind it. But no arrest has been made for now," Okasanmi.
