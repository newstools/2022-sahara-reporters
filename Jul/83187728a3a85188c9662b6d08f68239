Ifeanyi Ejiofor, the lawyer to the detained leader of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, has denied reports that the IPOB leader is missing in the facility of Department of State Services where he is being held.Ejiofor made the clarification in a statement titled, “Important clarification” on Friday in Abuja. He said contrary to reports, particularly an audio clip circulating online that Kanu was missing in detention, he visited Kanu on Thursday and confirmed that he was in the facility.He urged Nigerians to disregard the information, noting that it was handiwork of enemies andmischief makers.The statement read, “Please UMUCHINEKE, kindly ignore the audio message being mischievously promoted/circulated by the enemies of our people, to the effect that ONYENDU MAZI NNAMDI KANU is missing in DSS facility.“The information is fake, a blatant lie and should be totally ignored by Ezigbo UMUCHINEKE. Thank you and God bless. Always keep your eyes on the ball.”Recall that IPOB in a recent statement by its Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, had alleged that there was a plot to attack Kanu at the DSS facility.
