The All Progressives Congress (APC) Senatorial aspirant in Ebonyi State, Mrs. Ann Agom-Eze, has said that she still remains the party’s candidate for the Ebonyi South Senatorial District.Speaking with The Guardian on Monday in Abakaliki, Agom-Eze insisted that she was still in the race and had never accepted any gift from Governor David Umahi to step down for him. Recall that there was rumour which made the rounds that Agom-Eze collected N40 million Toyota Prado Jeep, a house, cash and landed property to step down for Governor Umahi who switched to contest for Senatorial seat after scoring 38 votes at the APC presidential primary election earlier in June.However, Agom-Eze denied the rumour, describing it as baseless, unfounded and diversionary.Her claim came after a Federal High Court sitting in Abakaliki ordered for a rerun primary for Ebonyi South Senatorial District with Mrs. Agom-Eze included in the list of contestants.The judgment was sequel to a suit filed before the court against the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) by Umahi, through his legal counsel, Roy Nweze Umahi.
