Some terrorists who planned to attack the Nigerian Law School in Abuja and later ambushed some Nigerian Army personnel in Bwari, the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, were led by two kingpins.According to Daily Nigerian, the terrorists were led by two banditry kingpins, Kachalla Ali Kawaje and Kachalla Dansadi. Kawaje, who controls hundreds of fighters in Kuyambana Forest, which stretches across Zamfara, Kebbi, Kaduna and Niger states, was responsible for shooting down a Nigerian Air Force jet on July 18, 2021.Security reports say the terrorists planned to attack the Central Mosque and worship centres and security formations in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).This is coming few weeks after terrorists who later identitfied themselves as members of the Islamic State - West African Province (ISWAP) attacked the Kuje Correctional Centre in the Nigeria’s capital, releasing over 800 inmates including 64 Boko Haram suspects and killed 10 inmates and one security officer. Intelligence sources also confirmed that the terrorists were planning to plant improvised explosive devices in open manholes around security formations, mosques, churches and public places.“Central Mosque, Abuja, was particularly targeted for attack,” the source said.The source further revealed that credible intelligence had revealed that the kidnappers and bandits terrorising Bwari general area are camping on the mountains and caves behind Usman Dam, linking Ushafa to Mpape satellite communities.“The terrorists have been mingling with the locals recently. They came on motorcycles from their camps to buy food and drugs in Ushafa and Mpape,” the security source added.The source said unless serious security measures are taken to frustrate their plans, the terrorists may strike any moment.Parts of the security measures advised during a recent security meeting are immediate replacement of the stolen manhole covers, ban on commercial motorcycles in the FCT and stepping up surveillance on the outskirts of the city.
