The Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) has slammed Sheikh Ahmad Gumi over a claim it described as false regarding pro-Biafra agitations in the country. The Islamic cleric had said that pro-Biafra agitation had reduced in the South-East because of Mr Peter Obi's emergence as a presidential candidate of the Labour Party in the 2023 general election.  But MASSOB in a statement on Tuesday described Gumi's claims as full of deceit and falsehood. MASSOB in the statement signed by its leader, Comrade Uchenna Madu, said so many pro-Biafra agitators have been in the self-determination struggle for Biafra actualisation and restoration. He said that Biafra agitators were not clamouring to have an Igbo man as the Nigerian president. The statement partly read, "Our agenda is known, our mission is stated, our position is unshakable and uncompromised and our goal is to actualize an independent state of Biafra through the principles of non-violence. "We can never be cowed or intimidated by the chief patron and negotiator of Fulani terrorist movement ravaging the entire Northern region and the rest of Nigeria in pursuit of President Muhammadu Buhari's Islamic agenda of islamising Nigeria. "MASSOB and other pro-Biafra organizations have nothing against Mr Peter Obi and his intentions to save Nigeria from further collapse.“He believes in Nigeria, we believe in Biafra. If Nigerians elect him based on his competency and pedigree as their new president, does it concern MASSOB? It's not our business. "Mr Peter Obi is not the first person to contest presidential election since September 1999 we started the MASSOB non-violence self-determination struggle. Why attach him to us now? "MASSOB advised Shiekh Gumi to explain his role and other Fulani cabals in the terrorist attack and breaking of Kuje prisons in Abuja. Don't use Mr Peter Obi and pro-Biafra agitation to divert attention."
