It was further reported by you that “the huge cash was part of the billions of Naira earmarked for the purchase of arms and ammunition by the Muhammadu Buhari-led government.” “This is a very serious allegation capable of brewing hatred and attack by the public against our Client as a former Chief of Army Staff. There is no doubt that Nigerians are seriously concerned about the security situation of the country and the said publication has portrayed our Client as a person responsible for diversion of funds meant for the fight against Boko Haram. “Consequently, our Client has been exposed to hate, ridicule and embarrassment from members of the public with his friends calling him from different parts of the world to ask for explanations.
