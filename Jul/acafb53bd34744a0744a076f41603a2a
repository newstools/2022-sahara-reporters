A Nigerian twitter user, Ayanfe Beloved Adeyemi, has featured an interview with Nigerian hold medallist female athlete, Tobi Amusan, who broke world record at the World Athletics Championship Women's 100m Hurdles in Oregon.Adeyemi berated the Nigerian government for “suddenly celebrating” Amusan, when she won the first ever Gold medal at the event. Like many young Nigerians whose morale was killed while trying to build their talents within the Nigerian shores, Adeyemi said that the Nigerian government almost killed Amusan’s morale and talent while she was in Nigeria.The 25-year-old woman from Ijebu Ode in Ogun State has been receiving applause from Nigerians and the Nigerian government since her victory. Reacting to the Nigerian government identifying with Amusan’s success, Adeyemi via @ayfbeloved recounted the athlete’s ugly experience while in Nigeria.He said, “Everyone suddenly cares of her (Tobi Amusan) success but I'm more interested in her story. They tried to kill her morale but now they (Nigeria government) are associating with her, including Eleyi the audio adopter. Indeed they turn it own elsewhere.” Everyone suddenly care of her (Tobi Amusan) success but I'm more interested in her story....They tried to killed her moral but now they (Nigeria government) are associating with her , including Eleyi the audio adopter... Indeed they turn it own else where.. pic.twitter.com/BuzkNP27qn
