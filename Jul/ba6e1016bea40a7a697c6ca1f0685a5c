Governors on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) have demanded that the presidential candidate of the party and former Governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu, pick one of them from the North-East as his running mate to serve as compensation for their roles during the party’s primary election. The governors argued that one of them deserved the running mate position because Tinubu’s emergence as the party’s standard bearer was due to their resistance against the APC National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, who attempted to impose on the party the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, as a consensus candidate, Vanguard reports.  It was also gathered that the governors had insisted that the presidential running mate may come from Borno State or a sitting governor from the North-West but not from Katsina State the home state of President Muhammadu Buhari. Meanwhile, Tinubu has insisted on going with the former Governor of Borno State, Senator Kashim Shettima. It was believed that Tinubu’s insistence on working with Senator Shettima was backed by stakeholders who want the North East, particularly Borno State, to produce the Vice President as a compensation for Senate Lawan’s failure to secure the party’s presidential ticket. “The APC governors are pushing that the presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, should pick his vice presidential candidate from among them because of the role they played to stop the action of the APC National Chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, who had already settled for the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, as the presidential candidate of the ruling party. “There are strong feelings that though the governors want one of them, Tinubu wants Senator Kashim Shettima as his vice-presidential candidate,” a source told Vanguard.
