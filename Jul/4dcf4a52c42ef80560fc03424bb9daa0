The Chairman and Convener of the Northern Elders Forum (NEF), Prof. Ango Abdullahi, has lost his eldest son, Isah Ango Abdullahi. Abdullahi is also a former Vice-Chancellor of Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria.  Isah reportedly died on Thursday evening in Abuja after a brief illness. It was learnt that the deceased would be taken to Haruna Danja Juma’at Mosque Zaria, Kaduna State on Friday for funeral prayers, which would be held by 1:30 pm, Daily Post reports.  Isah, who until his death was a staff member of the Nigerian Intelligence Agency (NIA) in Abuja, is survived by his wife and children.  Isah’s death could have been the second tragedy to hit the NEF chairman within a space of three months. Prof. Abdullahi’s son, who is a member of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Sadiq Ango Abdullahi, was among the passengers during the Abuja-Kaduna train attack by terrorists in March.  It is still not clear if Sadiq has been released by the terrorists. There were media reports between April 30th and May 2nd that he had been released.  However, on May 23rd, it was reported that Sadiq who was contesting for Sabon Gari Federal Constituency on the platform of PDP won the ticket from the kidnappers’ den.  Reports on May 30 said Sadiq lamented and called on the Nigerian government to come to their rescue in a video released by the terrorists.  The Daily Trust report quoted the NEF Chairman’s son as saying, “We are appealing to the federal government to once again come to our aid. We have been here for 62 days. Most of us here are sick and we are not in good condition and every day the situation deteriorates. We are appealing to the federal government to please come to our aid before we start losing our lives.”
