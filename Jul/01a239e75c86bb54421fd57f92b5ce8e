 Former Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi on Sunday said the ‘bishops’ who attended the recent unveiling of Kashim Shettima as the vice-presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) may not be real bishops. Amaechi, however, said they are Christians.  Following the event, there have been public criticisms and allegations that some persons who wore cassocks to the programme, appearing like bishops or other senior Christian clerics, were hired by the APC.  The incident caused a stir at the entrance of the venue as the crowd taunted them and shouted, "The bishops are here."  Meanwhile, the so-called bishops could not get seats at the main hall, as they were seen being ushered to the gallery which took care of the overflow.  Amaechi while speaking over the weekend at an event to mark the 60th birthday of Eugene Ogu, General Overseer of Abundant Life Evangel Mission in Port Harcourt, the Rivers capital, said the persons in question are Christians but many not be bishops, as portrayed.  “Those bishops you saw (at Kashim Shettima’s unveiling in Abuja], they may not be bishops, but they are Christians,” Amaechi said.  Rotimi Amaechi also said delegates, who sold their votes at the APC presidential primary election won by Bola Tinubu, were already regretting doing so. “I don’t believe that is the solution to Nigeria’s problem — giving money. I hope you know. I give you N10 million now and when it finishes, what happens? The solution to Nigeria’s problem is that all of you must rise.  “God should save the ordinary Nigerian because they are the problem. Those who voted at the APC primary, who are they? The ordinary Nigerian. The small money they got solved their immediate problems.  “Now ‘oh we made a mistake,' ‘we didn’t make a mistake.' We are hearing different things. Pray for the leadership of the country, but also pray that ordinary Nigerians choose the right person to govern," he said.
