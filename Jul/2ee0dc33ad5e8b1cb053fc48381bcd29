A Federal High Court has nullified the election of Sheriff Oborevwori, as the Peoples Democratic Party’s governorship candidate in Delta State for the 2023 general elections.  Oborevwori, who is currently the Speaker of the Delta State House of Assembly, is Governor Ifeanyi Okowa’s stooge and was allegedly imposed on the PDP in the state, causing internal ripples. SaharaReporters Media The court on Thursday nullified Oborevwori’s election as the PDP candidate based on certificates issues and ordered the party to conduct a new primary before the final date of change of candidates, SaharaReporters learnt.  The Electoral Act does not permit the runner-up to automatically become the candidate.  According to Fejiro Oliver, a journalist familiar with the development, “Sheriff Oborowheri has been disqualified by the Federal High Court on certificate issues. PDP has been asked to conduct a new primary before the final date of change of candidates  “This is where Okowa wants to actualise his Ijaw agenda to make James Manager the standard PDP flag bearer. He would rather die than see Edevbie succeed him.”  SaharaReporters had reported that Oborevwori emerged as the candidate of the PDP, after polling 590 out of 825 votes to beat former commissioner for finance, David Edevbie, who is the anointed candidate of former governor James Ibori with 113 votes to clinch the second position.  Okowa recently nominated the state internal revenue board chairman, Monday Onyeme as the running mate to Oborevwori.  SaharaReporters had reported that some chieftains and stakeholders of the party were angry that Okowa nominated the candidates without consulting them.  This has further aggravated crisis, with some of them now looking to leave the party, sources had told SaharaReporters.
