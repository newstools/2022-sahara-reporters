The Presidential candidate of the African Action Congress (AAC) party, Omoyele Sowore, has scolded a former President, Olusegun Obasanjo, for riding a commercial tricycle, popularly called Keke NAPEP in Abeokuta, Ogun State. Sowore, a human rights activist in a Facebook post, said the action of the former President wasn’t a sign of simplicity but a tale of depravity occasioned by the wickedness he unleashed on the people during his tenure.  Obasanjo was in charge of the Nigerian government between 1999 and 2007 – the foundational years of the economic recession, corruption and instability which the country is still grappling with. The former president had on Saturday turned himself into a commercial tricycle rider, picking and dropping passengers across parts of Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital.
