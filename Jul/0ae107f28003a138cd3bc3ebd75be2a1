Human rights lawyer, Femi Falana, SAN, has faulted the position of President Muhammadu Buhari that the Nigerian government lacked financial resources to fund the University education in Nigeria and resolve the ongoing strike by lecturers.Falana, who is also the Interim Chair, Alliance on Surviving Covid 19 and Beyond (ASCAB), said Buhari should immediately submit a Supplementary budget to the National Assembly for the appropriation of the sum of N200 billion required to revamp the federal universities. Buhari, who is the Visitor to all federal universities in the country, had on Monday, urged the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, to consider the long-term effects of the strike on students and the generational consequences on families, the educational system and the future development of the country.While lamenting that the strike was already taking a toll on the psychology of parents, students and other stakeholders, throwing up many moral issues that already beg for attention, the President had said that “enough is enough for keeping students at home. Don’t hurt the next generation for goodness sake."ASUU had declared warning strike on February 24, 2022 to force the federal government to implement 2009 ASUU/FG Agreement which Buhari's regime reneged.Meanwhile, Falana in a release obtained by SaharaReporters on Tuesday, described as preposterous that the federal government would say it lacked financial resources to fund university education, when it spent trillions in fuel subsidy and other areas while over N6trillion had also been expended in fighting insurgency with no tangible results.The human rights lawyer in a statement titled: "Time to end ASUU strike by President Muhammadu Buhari," said that the demand of Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) is in accordance with the FG/ASUU Agreement whose terms are binding on the Federal Government.The statement reads, "Four months ago, the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) commenced the current strike to compel the Federal Government to comply with the FG/ASUU Agreement on funding of all federal universities in Nigeria."According to the binding Agreement the total fund which the Federal Government ought to have provided to revamp the universities is N200 billion in line with its obligation under the Agreement. Before then, the warning strikes embarked upon by ASUU was ignored by the Federal Government."Thus, the ongoing industrial action which has paralysed the federal universities has lingered on due to the refusal of the Federal Government to meet its commitment under the FG/ASUU Agreement. However, in justifying the unwarranted breach of the Agreement the Federal Government has complained of lack of fund.""Instead of addressing the outstanding grey areas in the prolonged negotiations, President Muhammadu Buhari who is the Visitor to all federal universities in the country has urged ASUU to call off the strike."He added, "The claim of the Federal Government that it lacks the financial resources to fund university education has been taken with a pinch of salt by the Nigerian people.  Having regard to the way and manner huge public fund has been expended on other projects it does appear that the Federal Government has not prioritised higher education."For instance, the electricity sector and the counter insurgency operations in two regions in the country have consumed not less than N6 trillion without any tangible result. The Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) claims that N5.4 trillion is owed by a section of the comparador bourgeoisie whose toxic debts were bought with public fund."Even though N443 billion was spent on the importation of fuel from January to June 2022 the National Assembly has approved N4 trillion for the same product from July to December 2022 due to the comatose status of the nation’s refineries."The Federal Government has also made available N100 billion for revamping the textile industry; N850 billion for rice production; N250 billion for autogas vehicle conversion and N228 for school feeding programme. Apart from its annual budget of N40 billion the Independent National Electoral Commission has received N100 billion as the first tranche of the 2022 budget to conduct the 2023 general elections."A government that can afford to spend trillions of Naira on the aforesaid projects cannot afford to ignore the funding of higher education."
