An Afro-Italian of Nigerian descent, Victoria Oluboyo, was on Monday elected as the first Black African city councillor in Parma, Italy.Olufemi Iyanda, a Nigerian in diaspora made this known in a post on his Facebook page, noting that some years ago, when Nigerian names are mentioned, especially in Parma city, they were usually connected with prostitution and drug selling. He said “Some years ago, when Nigerian names are mentioned, especially in Parma city, they are usually connected with prostitution and drug selling. However with serious and concerted efforts by the Nigerian community, to which Victoria is a member, the narrative was changed.“First, Nigerian missionaries headed by Apostle and Bishop (Mrs) Adenitire are the first to get involved in rehabilitation and resettlement of trafficked and prostitution victims, through their charity organisation, Festival of Praise and Care, in collaboration with the Parma municipality.“We equally raised awareness and encouraged Nigerians in voluntary association and community development initiatives that today have placed Nigerians in enviable positions, not only in Parma but across the region.“We are glad that Victoria made us proud through her relentlessness and commitment to issues that bother on female rights and emancipation cum political activism that culminate in her success story today. Five years ago, she tried but failed but today, God has crowned her efforts with success.“While we wish her success, this is a clarion call on Nigerians resident in Italy to get more involved in community development activities and voluntary services and we are sure a better tomorrow and a promising future await our children born in the land," he added.
