The kidnappers of 15 farmers in the Mgbuji-Eha-Amufu community in the Isi-Uzo local government area of Enugu State have demanded a ransom of N30 million for their release.  SaharaReporters reported on Monday that gunmen suspected to be Islamic terrorists masquerading as herdsmen invaded Mgbuji community and kidnapped the farmers.  It reported that some of the victims were going to their farms when the terrorists abducted them along Mgbuji-Agu Road near Railway crossing in Mgbuji town while others were picked up on their farms.  Mgbuji and other neighbouring communities in Eha-Amufu have experienced constant attacks by bandits since September 2021. Many residents have been killed while hundreds of houses and property worth millions of naira have been destroyed. So many others have been kidnapped for ransom.  A relation of one of the victims, Olinya Odo, told SaharaReporters on Tuesday, that the kidnappers called on Monday night to demand a ransom of N30 million to secure the release of the farmers.  "They used the phone of my wife who is one of the victims to call us last night. They are demanding N30 million before they will release them. I have told my community leaders. I was also told that they have informed the police and soldiers.  "Where will I get N30 million from? If we have N30 million, will we be peasant farmers? We are begging them to release our people. As we speak, both the police and soldiers stationed in Eha-Amufu town haven't visited us. The police Divisional Officer in charge of Nkem police Division asked us to come to his office before he can do anything."  Efforts made by SaharaReporters to get the reaction of the state police public relations officer, Daniel Ndukwe, on the recent development were unsuccessful as he didn't answer his calls. He also did not reply to the text message sent to his mobile phone.
