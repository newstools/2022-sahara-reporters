Human rights lawyer, Femi Falana, SAN, on Tuesday joined the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) in the ongoing nationwide protest in solidarity with the striking Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU).The university lecturers have been on industrial action since February 14 over lingering issues with the federal government including university funding, earned allowances, payment system, reneging on signed Memorandum of Action, amongst others.  Joining the NLC nationwide solidarity protest in Lagos State, Falana said that the President Muuhammadu Buhari-led administration was dubious and had thrown Nigerians into poverty as living standards worsened under his watch.Falana, who said that Nigerians did not vote for a regime that would cause them hardship, said that Buhari had told Nigerians that he was tired and therefore, he (Buhari) should go home.Speaking during the protest, Falana said, “We are gathered here today at this protest ground to reject in its entirety the dubious acts of the Buhari-led administration.“The living standards of Nigerians appear to be getting worse every day. We didn’t vote for a regime to cause hardship for Nigerians, and that is what is going on. As we are gathered here today, terrorism, hardship, depression, recession have taken over our country, but President Buhari is junketing all over the world.“He has already told Nigerians that he is tired and he is anxious to go home. We are therefore saying today that Buhari must go. He must go. For the lecturers in our tertiary institutions and other workers, we are fully with you.”
