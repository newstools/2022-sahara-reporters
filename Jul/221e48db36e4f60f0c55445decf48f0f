A man, identified as Badejo Idowu, has been reportedly killed by his son, Tunde Badejo, over claims to a land belonging to the family in Karu Local Government Area of Nasarawa State.It was learnt that Tunde had been pestering his father for a portion of the land for over a year. When Daily Trust visited the scene on Monday, the deceased’s wife, Madam Tolani Badejo, said her husband asked Tunde to give him time to apportion the land fairly among other family members.“He had been on my husband’s neck for the land since last year. So during their last argument on Monday, he pulled out a knife and stabbed his father several times on the head, neck, chest, hands and legs which killed him. I raised the alarm and he fled," she explained.The second son of the deceased, Ayomide Badejo, said the matter had been reported to the police while his father’s remains had been deposited in a mortuary.
