The National Commercial Motorcycle and Tricycle Owners and Riders Association of Nigeria has faulted the federal government’s plan to ban operation of commercial motorcycles popularly known as okada riding across the country.Speaking on a programme on Monday on Nigeria Television Authority (NTA), the President of the association, Usman Gwoza, said that if the Federal Government goes ahead to enforce the nationwide ban on commercial motorcycles, it will render millions of riders jobless and poor.

And we are all Nigerians. Those operating are over 20 million but those registered with us are over 14 million people. If you ban people from what they rely on for daily bread, are you increasing crime or reducing it?” he questioned.Speaking further, he said that “Okada has become the main tool of employment by lawmakers. Now this disempowerment will worsen crime. If you ban 14 million people, what alternative are you making for them? None.”He added that rather than ban Okada’s, the Association would rather work in parallel with the government and the security agencies to secure the lives of Nigerians.
