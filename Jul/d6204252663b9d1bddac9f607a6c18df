A human rights lawyer, Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, SAN, has said that the presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, has no independent mind and would not defend the unity of Nigeria in crucial moments of decision-making.Adegboruwa stated this in reaction to the choice of the former Lagos governor to pick Senator Kashim Shettima, a fellow Muslim as running mate despite oppositions from other faiths. The senior lawyer noted that the APC presidential candidate had no mind of his own and he would be “unable to defend the unity of Nigeria in crucial moments of decision making.”In the statement titled "The Grave Implications Of APC Muslim-Muslim Ticket", the human rights lawyer said that for Tinubu to go for a Muslim Muslim ticket, showed that he had no consideration for unity and plurality of Nigeria.While noting that the Muslim- Muslim ticket was borne out of desperation and over-ambition, Adegboruwa described it as "cruel affirmation of supposed superiority complex that only one region determines electoral victory."The statement made available to SaharaReporters on Tuesday, read, "Muslim-Muslim ticket shows we just want power at all costs and we don’t care what others think or do."We can win the elections without you, especially by other means other than by open ballot."It is a cruel affirmation of supposed superiority complex. That only one region determines electoral victory. That the presidential candidate of the APC is not acceptable to Northern Muslims."The legal luminary said that Muslim-Muslim ticket is an indication of a hidden agenda, adding that "the spirit of Hope 93 died with MKO and those who betrayed him and his mandate. May Boko Haram, terrorists and insurgents, their sponsors and sympathisers not win the 2023 elections.""That Nigeria is not a secular state but rather being ruled to satisfy certain religious tendencies. That the APC has absolute control of the electoral system and thus electoral victory may not be determined through free, fair and credible elections."That certain political tendencies and interests do not trust others to accommodate them if they are entrusted with power whereas they have been in power and accommodated by others."That the APC presidential candidate has no mind of his own and he will be unable to defend the unity of Nigeria in crucial moments of decision making."That the APC is incompetent to manage a complex nation like Nigeria with diverse interests, different tongues and tribes and consisting of different faiths."
