Barely two days to the Osun State’s governorship election, the People's Redemption Party (PRP) has withdrawn from the race.The National Executive Committee of the party explained that the decision was made following the impact of the lack of political activities from its standard bearer. The party’s NEC accused its Osun governorship candidate, Ayowole Adedeji, of staying outside of the country since he emerged as the party’s governorship candidate and only travelled back to the country two weeks before the election.This was contained in a statement released on Thursday by the National Secretary of the party, Babatunde Alli.He said a committee had been instituted to probe the governorship candidate also for soliciting funds for his campaign without holding any.It read, “The National Executive Committee of our great party, the PRP has noted with great concern and disappointment, the negative effects of obvious inactivity of the Governorship Candidate of the party in Osun State, MR. Ayowole Adedeji, both on the party structures in Osun State and at the National level."The National Executive Committee has therefore considered all options and hereby directs the withdrawal of the PRP from the Osun State Governorship Election of 16th July 2022.“In addition, the State Chapter is hereby directed to set up a 5-man Disciplinary Committee to investigate the Governorship Candidate of the Party for the following: Staying abroad since emerging governorship candidate of the party till only two (2) weeks before the election, thereby preventing the party from all campaigns and awareness creation efforts;“Alleged fund-raising overseas activities without corresponding campaigns in the name of the party at State level.“The party particularly considers this allegation very grievous and debasing to the PRP; and alleged attempt to fraudulently trade the party for personal monetary gains thereby embarrassing the party and dragging its good name and principles in the mud.”
