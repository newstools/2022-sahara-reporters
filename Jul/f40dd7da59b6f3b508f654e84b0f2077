President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday told the vice-presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Kashim Shettima that he will respond to his speech when he is handing over to him and his boss, Bola Tinubu. Buhari said this while hosting Shettima at the State House in Abuja on Wednesday.  "I will respond to your speech when I am handing over to you and your boss. God willing, you are going to win," Buhari was quoted in a statement released by Garba Shehu Senior Special Assistant to the President on Wednesday. Buhari, who received the VP candidate shortly after he was unveiled by the leadership of the party and Tinubu, the party’s presidential candidate, said he was very happy with the choice of the former governor of Borno State as Tinubu’s running mate. “I wish you the best. Your consistency at the party is very respectful.  You served your two terms as Governor and finished well. You have kept touch with your base. At every important occasion or event, you are maintaining support for the one who succeeded you.  This is commendable,” he said. The President expressed strong optimism that the APC ticket will emerge victorious in 2023. In his remarks, Shettima thanked Buhari for his “empathy, support and positive role," leading to his emergence as running mate to the APC presidential candidate. He praised the President for having “a special place in your heart for Borno and Northeast,” adding, “I can cite 20-30 instances of support you have rendered, for which you will be remembered." Shettima asked Buhari to appreciate his successor, Babagana Zulum who was with him, along with the Minister of State for Agriculture, Mustapha Baba Shehuri, for his support. He said he would not be for the “troika of Hausa, Fulani and Kanuri,” but for all of Nigeria, irrespective of ethnicity, religion or geographical place of origin.
