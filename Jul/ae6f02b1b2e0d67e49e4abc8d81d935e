The organised labour movement in Nigeria has disclosed that it will hold a one-day protest across the country over the federal government's approach to the ongoing industrial action by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU).The movement noted that the protest is also to call the attention of the Nigerian government to the country’s worsening security situation and the unending power crisis in the country. The President of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Mr. Ayuba Wabba and the President of the National Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE), Mr. Ambali Olatunji, who disclosed the plan while speaking at a one day conference in Abuja, condemned in strongest terms the deteriorating security situation in Nigeria.Wabba, while calling on the federal government to act fast on the aforementioned issues said, “For four months and running, the children of the poor have remained at home. Today as we speak, diesel is selling for more than N800 per litre. There is no way this situation can be allowed to continue.“So I think there’s an urgency in addressing this issue. And therefore, the central working committee decided that there will be a one-day national protest to call the attention of the government to resolve this issue immediately.”
