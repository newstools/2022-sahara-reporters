The sldrs have been evacuated to 7 Gds Bn MRS for med attn,” the signal read.“Details on the extent of their injuries still under cfm. The ambushed attk happening within the gen area of Bwari shows that the terrs are actually within the loc and possibly to carry out their plans of attacking the law schl in Bwari as earlier reported.”The attack comes after the management of the Federal Government College, Kwali, Abuja, asked parents to evacuate their wards from the school over the fear of invasion by the terrorists.The school management asked the parents to evacuate their wards following an attack in a nearby village “that shares a fence” with the school.“Following the threat letter from the terrorists, the leadership of the Nigerian Law School drew the attention of the military authorities at the 7 Guards Brigade.“The late army captain (names withheld) and the soldiers were dispatched to the school for preliminary investigation. They had a discussion with authorities at the school and agreed on what to do to safeguard students, teachers and school facilities. Sadly on their way back, the terrorists ambushed them and that was how the captain and two soldiers were killed,” a source told Daily Trust.The source said other persons in the party escaped the attackers by whiskers.Another source said following the threat, there was a plan to dispatch a joint task force to beef up security around the law school and Bwari at large.He said besides the law school, other facilities in Bwari, especially those belonging to the government are now under threat and the people were now living in fear.“This is the height of onslaught on the Federal Capital Territory, the seat of power,” he said.“But the truth is that the threats have been there for long, nobody in the security circle in Nigeria will tell you that he or she is not aware of the threat on Abuja and the FCT at large.“The terrorists have established cells in many communities around the FCT. That is why abductions have become a daily occurrence around Kuje, Gwagalada and the remaining area councils in the last one year or thereabouts.“The target of the terrorists is to embarrass the government. They are in control of many communities in all the contiguous states to the FCT and they are finally here,” he said.
