Human rights activist and presidential candidate of the African Action Congress (AAC), Omoyele Sowore, has condemned the brutality meted out to the founder of the Mountain of Holy Ghost Intervention and Deliverance Ministry, Onitsha, Prophet Chukwuemeka Ohanaemere aka Odumeje, by officials of the Anambra State task force. Sowore asked that the soldiers and policemen involved in the act be arrested and prosecuted by the appropriate authorities.  SaharaReporters had reported earlier that the officials in collaboration with the security agents beat up Odumeje for daring to confront them during the demolition of a section of his church in the Fegge area of Onitsha on Thursday. The church is popularly known as the “land of freedom and miracle centre.” The government of Chukwuma Soludo had shortly after he was sworn in as the governor of Anambra, marked the ministry for demolition in what residents tagged as witch-hunt for the cleric’s failure to support him during the Governorship election that brought him in November, 2021. Meanwhile, the AAC presidential candidate, Sowore, condemned the treatment meted out to the pastor, while describing the actions of the soldiers and policemen as degrading. This attack on Pastor Chukwuemeka Ohanaemere âOdumejeâ by soldiers/policemen is cruel, inhuman and a violation of his dignity, it amounts to torture and degrading treatment. The soldiers or policemen involved must be arrested and prosecuted. pic.twitter.com/6A1A9OqRev  Sowore noted that states must be disallowed from using soldiers and security agents to carry out civilian activities. He tweeted, “This attack on Pastor Chukwuemeka Ohanaemere “Odumeje” by soldiers/policemen is cruel, inhuman and a violation of his dignity, it amounts to torture and degrading treatment. The soldiers or policemen involved must be arrested and prosecuted. "Nigerian states must be disallowed from using soldiers and security agents to carry out civilian activities. #WeCantContinueLikeThis.”
