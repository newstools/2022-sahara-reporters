A seven-year-old boy known as Ayuba has been killed while four residents were abducted by gunmen suspected to be bandits at Paikon Basa community in Gurdi ward of Abaji Area Council of Abuja. A man and his wife were also hit by stray bullets in the attack where the bandits raided some shops and carted away food stuffs.  A resident who spoke with Daily Trust said bandits wielding sophisticated weapons invaded the community on Friday night. He said, “In fact, the entire Paiko community was terrified because of the sound of gunshots of the bandits. It was as a result of the sporadic shooting that a seven-year-old boy was killed.” Confirming the incident, the district head of Gulida, Abubakar Sadauna, noted that the couple who were shot had been taken to a private hospital for treatment in Gwagwalada. “I later received information over the weekend that two among the four kidnapped victims, later escaped from the abductors den. "Yaba police division headquarters had been informed about the attack, the police went to the scene and saw the corpse of the seven-year-old boy before he was buried," the head said. According to the report, the bandits proceeded to neighbouring Mawogi community, two kilometres away from Gasakpa and abducted six villagers.
