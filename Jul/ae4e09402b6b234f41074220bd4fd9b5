The Nigerian Defence Headquarters, Abuja, has denied the allegations by a former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode in a viral video that soldiers at the Kuje Correctional Centre, Abuja, were withdrawn a few minutes before the terrorists’ attack on Tuesday night.The military authorities said the allegations in Fani-Kayode’s video were intended to smear the military and create bad blood between service personnel and the military high command. A statement by the Director, Defence Information, Major General Jimmy Akpor, made available to SaharaReporters on Saturday, said that Fani-Kayode's claims could be part of a calculated attempt to cause division and rivalry amongst all government agencies that have been working collaboratively in addressing issues of insecurity in the country.In the statement titled: "Re: Unsubstantiated Allegations Against The Armed Forces Of Nigeria By Mr Femi Fani-kayode In A Viral Video In Circulation," General Akpor described the former Minister as a known Rabble-Rouser and attention seeker, while noting that his claim was nothing more than sheer ignorance.The statement partly reads, "The attention of the Defence Headquarters has been drawn to a video produced by Mr Femi Fani-Kayode, wherein he made wild and unsubstantiated allegations against the Armed Forces of Nigeria, regarding the recent spate of terrorist attacks particularly, the attack of the prison in Kuje - Abuja on 5 July 2022."Ordinarily the video and its maker would have been ignored, considering the antecedents of the person behind it as a known Rabble-Rouser. However, in the interest of members of the public who might be misled by the deliberate falsehood and the sensibilities of service personnel and their families who have been paying dearly to keep Nigerians safe, it has become urgent to respond to the video currently circulating in the social media."Among other allegations, Mr Femi Fani-Kayode claimed that the Department of State Security (DSS) informed the military about the impending attack on Kuje Custodial Centre and even the previous attack on the Kaduna - Abuja rail service. He also claimed that soldiers were withdrawn shortly before the prison attack. In all these allegations, Mr Kayode is merely playing to the gallery."He is not in any position to know whether the DSS notified the military of any attack or not. It may not be impossible that such a claim is part of a calculated attempt to cause division and rivalry amongst all Government Agencies that have been working collaboratively in addressing issues of insecurity in the country."It added, "The claim that soldiers were withdrawn from the Kuje Correctional Custodial Centre before the attack is laughable. It is sad that Mr Kayode is ignorant of whose responsibility it to guard prison."Mr Fani-Kayode further claimed that the military took no action on the recent Shiroro terrorists’ attack, which resulted in the unfortunate death of some soldiers, some policemen and members of the public. This is also an attempt to smear the military and create bad blood between service personnel and the military high command."A despicable statement that dishonours the sacrifices of the gallant officers and soldiers that paid the supreme price whilst responding in defence of the civilians and the mining community. What a shame! Mr Kayode is encouraged to pay more attention to the weekly briefs by Defence Media Operations. Defence Media Operations gives weekly briefs/updates on operations being conducted across the country; press releases on military operations are also made when the need arises."Mr Fani-Kayode is also called to refresh himself on the constitutional roles of the Armed Forces of Nigeria. In all, subordination to civil authority is key. It is pertinent to state that, the Nigerian Armed Forces have toiled to sustain and nurture our democracy, hence the same military cannot contemplate a coup detat, as alluded to by Mr Kayode in his video."General Akpor, however, maintained the commitment of the Nigerian Ministry to uphold the tenet of democracy.
