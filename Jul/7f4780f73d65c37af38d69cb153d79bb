Anti-graft agency, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has arrested a man, identified as Nurudeen, for allegedly buying votes for ruling All Progressive Congress (APC) in Isale Osun in the ongoing Osun State gubernatorial election.According to EFCC officials, he was arrested while giving people cash at AUD Primary School and he mentioned working with a chieftain of APC in the state. SaharaReporters earlier reported that there was vote-buying in the ongoing Osun State governorship election by the ruling APC and the main opposition, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).According to some observers of the election, in some of the polling units, the APC agents "rewarded" voters with an amount between N5,000 and N10,000 after casting their votes while the PDP gave N4,000 and above to voters after forcing them to swear an oath in confirmation that they voted for the candidate of the party.At Ward 03, Ikija 11, Polling Unit 002, C.A.C Primary School, Ifetedo, Ife-South Local Government Area, an APC agent reportedly gave a "pass" to those who vote for his party as he directed them to a house close to the polling unit to get N5,000.Also, at a polling unit located in Salvation Army Grammar School, Alekuwodo in Osogbo the State capital, voters were seen going into a house three blocks away from the polling unit where money was being shared.According to witnesses, some voters were given N4,000 after showing proof that they voted for the PDP while those who could not show proof of voting for the party were asked to swear before they were given the money.
