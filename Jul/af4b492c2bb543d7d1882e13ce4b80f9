Terrorists have released three victims, two males and a female, of 62 hostages who are the Abuja-Kaduna train passengers, abducted since March 28 on Monday.The victims were released by the terrorists at a location inside the forest along the Kaduna–Abuja highway.  From there, they were picked up by their relatives, Channels TV reports.  This brought the total number of victims that had regained their freedom to 22, which means about 40 people are still in the custody of the terrorists.Recall that terrorists had on March 28 blown up the rail track, killing some and abducting scores of passengers, a situation that called for serious concern about the safety of the nation’s train.Due to the attack, the Nigeria Railway Corporation temporarily suspended activities, with President Muhammadu Buhari directing security agencies to rescue the victims.SaharaReporters had reported on Sunday that the terrorists, via a viral video were seen flogging their hostages and also threatened to abduct President Buhari and the Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai.The presidency reacted to the threat hours after, accusing the insurgents of using propaganda to compel the government to yield to their demands.In a statement, the Senior Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, claimed that the security forces were not helpless in stemming the tide of insecurity confronting the country.In his usual rhetoric, Shehu had said, “The Presidency, in the meantime wishes to reassure the public that the President has done all, and even more than what is expected of him as Commander-in-Chief by way of morale, material and equipment support to the military and expects nothing short of good results in the immediate.”
