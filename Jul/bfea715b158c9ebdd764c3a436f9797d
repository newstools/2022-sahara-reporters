The African Action Congress has disclaimed one James Adeshina as the governorship candidate of the party in Lagos State.The party also asked the Nigerian Television Authority not to allow him to appear on the station’s programme. Adesina was earlier expected to appear on the television station on Sunday, July 17.“AAC has asked NTA to disinvite this fellow (Adeshina) because he’s not the governorship candidate of the party,” a top party source told SaharaReporters.The AAC had recently been rescued from impostors and proxies of the government and the Independent National Electoral Commission who wanted to hijack its activities.In June, the Court of Appeal in Abuja had affirmed Omoyele Sowore as the substantive chairman of the AAC.The appellate court set aside the judgment of the lower court recognising Leonard Nzenwa as acting chairman and awarded N200,000 as damages in favour of Sowore.Few days after the appeal court judgement, the human rights activist won the presidential ticket of the AAC.Sowore was declared the winner unopposed at the party’s national convention in Abuja, which was monitored by officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and attended by members of the party across the country.The activist will be up against Bola Tinubu, APC standard-bearer, Atiku Abubakar, PDP presidential candidate; Peter Obi, Labour Party presidential candidate, and others in the 2023 general elections.
