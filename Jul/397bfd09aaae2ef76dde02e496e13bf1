Two locals (labourers) were also killed by the bandits while the bandits were running away into the forest,” he said.Ishaq said the hospital was accidentally burnt due to the fire that spread from a burning vehicle.He said the casualty figure between the armed bandits and the Ansaru members couldn’t be ascertained but said the Ansaru members defended the town from the bandits’ attack.The group said the attack was organised because the bandits knew the Ansaru members were in the town.He said ‎the Ansaru members continued with their preaching after the fight as they advised the people to acquire arms to defend themselves against enemies as well as fight government in order to establish what they refer to as Islamic State.
