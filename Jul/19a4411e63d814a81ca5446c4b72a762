Governor Matawalle made this appeal in a video obtained by SaharaReporters in his village, Maradun.He explained that if the retirement age was extended, it would afford those of them that are not tired to continue to serve the country.He said this would help sustain successes recorded in the fight on terror and insecurity.The governor said, “As you know that we are facing the issue of insecurity in Zamfara. I want to make Zamfara the most peaceful state in Nigeria. I want to make the people of Zamfara secure.”“I will ensure that Zamfara is the most peaceful state, the most secure state in Nigeria. I’m working with some security to achieve this.
