The impeached Deputy Governor of Oyo State, Rauf Olaniyan, has accused the Chief Judge of the state, Justice Munta Abimbola, and the investigation panel that probed the allegations raised against him (Olaniyan) of bribery. Olaniyan, who had earlier faulted the CJ over the constitution of the seven-man panel, made the accusation in a statement by his lawyer, Afolabi Fashanu (SAN), on Monday.  The impeached Deputy Governor alleged that the investigation panel was paid to ensure his removal. Olaniyan described the judgment passed against him by the panel as a charade that would not stand the test of time, adding that the panel members allowed themselves to be compromised and used to do a hatchet job. In a statement, the impeached deputy governor, through his lawyer, said, “The investigation by the committee set up by the Honorable Chief Judge is a charade that cannot stand the test of time. In the first instance, the Honorable Chief Judge, with respect, breached his oath of office by ignoring the service of notice of appeal and application for injunction pending appeal when he proceeded to constitute the investigation committee. “This is against established law and practice. On the part of the panel, they were appointed and paid to do a budge job, which must be contrary to good conscience. “They served the Deputy Governor on Friday around 10:45 am and asked him to appear at 11am. We wrote to inform them that His Excellency needed time to prepare for his defence, in their desperation to do the job for which they were paid, they rejected the letter, sat on Saturday and completed their task the same day. “Where is the fairness here? The members of the committee are supposed to be men above board. You have a Reverend father, a Jerusalem Pilgrim, and an Alhaji among them. This is a clear evidence that we are not yet ripe for democratic practice.”
