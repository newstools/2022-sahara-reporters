The presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, on Monday, said he entered the “match” of the 2023 general elections and his only aim is to win and not to work for the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar. Obi while speaking on Channels TV on Monday evening, noted that he had all what it took to defeat Atiku.  The former Anambra State governor, Obi was running mate to Atiku in the 2019 general elections and despite his acclaimed eloquence, the duo lost to the incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari. In the buildup to the 2023 elections, Obi had “divorced” Atiku and opted to run on the platform of the Labour Party as its presidential candidate. Atiku, however, said last Friday in an Arise TV interview that Obi could not perform any miracle to win the presidential election in 2023. However, when Obi was asked on Channels TV about the possibility of him working with Atiku if the chance arose, he said he was in the contest to win, adding that he had all it took to win. Obi said, “Nobody goes into a match thinking of what will happen. Everyone is going into it to win. I’m going into this contest to be the next President of Nigeria… I think I have all it takes to win.”
