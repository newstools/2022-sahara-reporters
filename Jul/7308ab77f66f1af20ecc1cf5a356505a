A heavy downpour has disrupted the ongoing Osun State governorship election in the Ife South Local Government Area of the state.The rain forced the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) officials and voters to scamper for shelter in nearby buildings close to the polling units. Voting materials, including the cubicles already set up for the process were dismantled immediately the rain started.The election which is been contested by 15 political parties, is a major duel between the incumbent governor, Gboyega Oyetola of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Senator Ademola Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).Other candidates in the race are the former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Lasun Yusuf of the Labour Party, Goke Omigbodun of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and Akin Ogunbiyi of Accord Party.More voters are expected to participate in the election than the 2018 poll when 767,444 electorates out of the 1,668,524 registered voters exercised their franchise.The election recorded 45.99 per cent turnout.In 2018, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declared Oyetola as winner, having polled 255,505 votes against Adeleke, who had 255,023 votes at the end of a supplementary election, which held in seven polling units across four local governments amidst allegations of harassment and other forms of malpractice.
