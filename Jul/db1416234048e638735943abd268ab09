The Archbishop of Ondo Ecclesiastical Province and the Anglican Bishop of Akure Diocese, Rev. Simeon Borokini, has urged Nigerians to get licensed guns to protect themselves against terrorists and bandits wreaking havoc across the country. Borokini spoke during the Synod at St. Andrews Anglican Church, Oyemekun, Akure, in Ondo State amid the failure of Muhammadu Buhari’s government to curb insecurity in the country.  He condemned the worsening insecurity in the country and urged people to defend themselves against terrorists, Vanguard reports. He said, “Well, I won’t oppose the call for churches to defend themselves because the government seems to be insensitive to the security situation in the country. So, anybody that is willing to get something to protect himself, should get it licensed, if it is a gun. “If it is to protect, I will support it, since the government seems to be negligent as far as security is concerned. Promises made by the government to protect citizens from terrorists and criminals have not been kept; instead, the country has become more unstable than it has been in decades. “The recent surge of insecurity has been linked to poverty across the country. The nation is abundantly blessed but criminally youth unemployment is alarming and the country is in the middle of one of the economic downturns. “Nigeria, God’s own country, the giant of Africa, a nation flowing with milk and honey, is now a place where everyone is avoiding partnering with or even coming to invest in. “Even, the citizens are running from the country to go and look for a greener pasture and find solace somewhere else as a result of the security challenges. “The nation is faced with an unprecedented wave of different but overlapping insurgencies and almost every corner has been hit by violence and crime.”
