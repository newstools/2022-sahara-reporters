  A young man who identified himself as Emmanuel Ojochagbe Peter has lamented the extortion of N2,000,000 from him by policemen in the Federal Capital Territory. He said the incident occurred on Tuesday around Byazhin in Kubwa, Abuja.  Narrating the incident in a series of tweets, Peter said he was treated like a criminal by the policemen who accused him of being a kidnapper.  According to him, he was later forced to transfer N500,000 four times to one Atatu Ramatu with First Bank account number 2038518054. “I was dragged in a bus by six police men yesterday at Byazhin across kubwa, they collected my phone from me by force, asked me to unlock my phone which i did after going through my phone and seeing nothing they started calling me a kidnapper,” he tweeted.  “I started begging that i was innocent, then they said I better cooperate with them or else I won’t like what’s going to happen to me, I said please sir I’m cooperating, we where on the road going to their station that’s what they said.  “They then forced me to open my bank app and transferred five hundred thousand (500,000) four times because my limit per transaction is 500,000, thats how they sent 2 million naira from my account and dropped me off at Gwaripa.”  DSP Josephine Adeh, the Police Public Relations Officer for the Federal Capital Territory, however, told SaharaReporters that she was not aware of the case. She asked for Peter's Twitter handle, saying she would take up the matter.
