The Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) on Tuesday began its two-day nationwide protest in solidarity with the strike action of the Academic Staff Union of Universities.Members of the Nigeria Labour Congress are presently protesting in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, in solidarity with the strike action of ASUU. The protest is also being held in other states such as Kaduna, Edo, Kano, and Lagos states.It has reportedly grounded government and official activities across the states as photographs of the protest marches are obtained by SaharaReporters.The protest, the NLC said, is also an opportunity for the workers to bring the attention of the government and other relevant agencies to several other issues affecting the nation.The scores of protesters who stormed the street carried placards with several inscriptions that called on the relevant agencies to attend to their demands.The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has been at loggerheads with the Federal Government since February 14 over the latter’s failure to honour some past agreements, among others.The disagreement has kept students of public universities at home for the past five months.Some other unions in the university system are also on strike due to disagreements with the Federal Government for different reasons.
