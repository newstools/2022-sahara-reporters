The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has asked women in the South-East region to ignore an advice by Bruce Fein, the United States-based legal adviser to the leader of the group, Nnamdi Kanu, asking the women to stage a protest in Abuja for the release of Kanu.SaharaReporters had days ago reported that Fein asked women of the South-East region of Nigeria to stage a protest in street of Abuja and at the National Assembly to demand the release of Kanu from the custody of the Department of State Service (DSS) where he has been held since June 2021 after he was “abducted” in Kenya.  But reacting to Fein’s order, the IPOB spokesperson, Emma Powerful, in a statement on Friday asked the women to ignore the order, noting that Fein was only a legal adviser to IPOB and not its spokesperson.IPOB noted that holding a protest in Abuja under the Muhammadu Buhari government was a suicide mission and should be ignored.The IPOB spokesperson disassociated the group from Fein’s order, saying that the lawyer overstepped his bounds as IPOB legal adviser in issuing such a directive which would expose women to avoidable danger.Powerful said, “Following the opinion of USA-based IPOB legal adviser Mr. Bruce Fein, asking IPOB women to embark on a street protest in Abuja, we the global movement of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) ably led by our great leader Mazi Nnamdi KANU wish to completely disassociate from such opinion and instruct Biafran women to please ignore such opinion and avoid the unnecessary risk.“We wish to state also that Bruce Fein overstepped his bounds as IPOB legal adviser in issuing such a directive which will only expose our women to avoidable dangers and harm.“Bruce Fein is our legal adviser and not IPOB Spokesperson. He does not quite understand that the version of Democracy operational in Nigeria is different from the real Democracy being practiced in the US where he resides.“In the US, protests are part and a common feature of Democracy and protesters enjoy protection from security agencies. But maybe unknown to him, in Nigeria, protesters are termed terrorists and shot on sight. To protest in Nigeria, particularly under the regime of President Muhammadu Buhari, is a suicide mission.“IPOB will not advise Biafra women to hit the streets for any protest now because their safety is not guaranteed. We have lost a lot of innocent souls in the past protests and the international community watched without any intervention.“Therefore, we won't allow more people to be sent to their untimely grave by wicked security operatives in Nigeria who run away from terrorists and Fulani bandits in the North but shamelessly show their might when it has to do with unarmed agitators of self-determination in the South.“We understand the concern of Mr Bruce Fein but we advise him to restrict himself strictly to providing legal services to our Movement, and refrain from dishing out unapproved directives to Biafrans. Such overzealousness could be counter-productive because we operate in a peculiar and very difficult environment.“We have done a lot of protests in the past and a lot of innocent Biafrans were killed in cold blood by security agencies. We do not want a repeat of that again.“We, therefore, urge all Biafrans to please ignore such directive from Bruce Fein, and any other of such directive not emanating from IPOB Spokesman and communicated through our proper channels of information dissemination.“Biafran women would never obey any orders no matter how important nor high the office through which it is issued especially when it is not within the purview of responsibility of the  personality issuing such directive. Directives for IPOB women and Biafrans to embark on outdoor activities which include protest go through certain processes before such an exercise is implemented because we understand this part of the world better.“It would be in our collective best interest if Bruce Fein would concentrate on his job and desist from meddling into Biafraland related matters and areas outside the purview of his brief. Bruce Fein is aware that we have some of the best lawyers here in Biafraland but they never issue orders or directives in IPOB but proffer only legal advice when necessary. Bruce Fein is advised to stay off IPOB administrative matters and concentrate on his legal representation.”
