Ondo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has said people from Southern Nigeria should not be bothered by the Muslim-Muslim ticket of the ruling All Progressives Congress because of their fight for Presidency to be zoned to the region. He called on Nigerians, especially southerners who have fought for the Presidency to be zoned to the region to vote for competence and not based on the religions of candidates. Rotimi Akeredolu The ruling All Progressives Congress has been criticised by members of the public for planning to field presidential and vice-presidential candidates, Bola Tinubu and Kashim Shettima respectively, who are both Muslims. The governor while speaking at the swearing-in of two new commissioners in Ondo on Wednesday noted that the presidential candidate of the APC, Tinubu will rescue the nation, Daily Post reports. “Muslim-Muslim ticket has nothing to do with performance. Let’s vote for someone that can do something. The work stops at the table of the President. It is the President that you are voting for. He decides what happens. Whether it’s a Muslim/Muslim or Christian/Christian, it should not matter to us in the South because we fought for this. “I have no doubt that given the opportunity, from what he has done in Lagos, Asiwaju Tinubu will turn things around for the better,” he said. He charged the new commissioners in his state to shun distractions from members of their families, friends and political associates. The governor said he was excited to have personalities imbued with the requisite capacity for the advancement of the cause of good governance. He stressed that his administration will always be bold to demand commitment and loyalty which must be absolute, adding that his administration had commenced a political journey on the path of rectitude.
