President Muhammadu Buhari who is currently in Senegal will on Friday depart the country for Nigeria. The President is scheduled to be in his home state, Katsina for the Eid-El-Kabir celebrations, SaharaReporters learnt on Thursday night. Buhari had on Wednesday departed Abuja for Dakar, the Senegalese capital to participate in the International Development Association for Africa Summit.The trip came barely 24 hours after a convoy of cars carrying the Advance Team of security guards, protocol and media officers ahead of the President’s trip to Daura for Sallah, came under terrorist attack.The attack by the terrorists left two persons in the convoy injured.“The attackers opened fire on the convoy from ambush positions but were repelled by the military, police and DSS personnel accompanying the convoy.“Two persons in the convoy are receiving treatment for the minor injuries they suffered and few personnel, who lost their lives have been deposited at the hospital. All the other personnel, staff and vehicles made it safely to Daura,” Garba Shehu, a presidential spokesman had said in a statement.Also on Tuesday night, terrorists attacked Kuje Correctional Centre in Abuja, the nation's capital, killing some of the inmates and an official of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC). The assailants freed hundreds of inmates including Boko Haram terrorists held at the prison facility.The Islamic State-backed faction of Boko Haram, known as the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) on Wednesday claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack on the prison facility. In a video, the terrorist group showed some of its men shooting their way into the facility.However, a source on Thursday told SaharaReporters that the President would be in Daura on Friday for the Eid-El-Kabir celebration despite the terrorist attacks.“Buhari will return to Daura tomorrow for Salah. And he’ll be there till probably July 16th because the officials are returning to Abuja on the 17th."Even after the attack, they still proceeded for the Salah preparation and they are currently waiting for him to come back tomorrow," the source said. In December 2020, bandits abducted scores of school children at Government Science Secondary School, Kankara, in Kankara Local Government Area of Katsina State a few hours after Buhari arrived in the state for a week-long private visit.Kankara is about 190 km (a two and half hours drive) by road from Daura while Abuja is some 384 km away.The President who refused to visit the scene was seen days later in a video checking up on his cows.
