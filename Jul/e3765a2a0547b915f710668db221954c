 Angry students of the Rufus Giwa Polytechnic, Owo in Ondo State on Friday took to the streets to protest the death of their colleague, Alayori Folarera Ademola, who was killed by operatives of the Ondo State Security Network Agency, codenamed Amotekun.SaharaReporters had earlier reported that the operatives of Amotekun killed a student of Rufus Giwa Polytechnic, Owo.  The student was identified as Alayori Folarera Ademola.He was shot by the operatives of Amotekun corps, who invaded a students’ area around the school last week.Sources told SaharaReporters that the deceased was rushed to Federal Medical Centre in Owo where he died on Thursday night.“Amotekun busted their villa and this guy got shot. He was taken to FMC but died last night,” the source told SaharaReporters on Friday.It was learnt that the security operatives also killed another person in the town during the operation but the identity of the deceased could not be ascertained at the time of filing this report.Another source added, “This set of useless Amotekun (personnel) came to Owo to kill my church member; till now, none of them has been arrested.”The security outfit was recently accused of randomly checking mobile phones and laptops of residents of the state.They were also said to be arresting drivers without licences and impounding vehicles without tinted permits.However the protesting students on Friday carried the deceased corpse to the gate of the state Government House in Akure.The angry students that were armed with placards singing different songs demanded that the Amotekun agents that allegedly killed Ademola be brought to book.
