A chieftain of the New Nigerian Peoples Party (NNPP), Buba Galadima has ruled out the possibility of the party's presidential candidate, Rabiu Kwankwaso being the running mate of its Labour Party counterpart, Mr Peter Obi in the 2023 presidential election. SaharaReporters earlier reported that Kwankwaso on Saturday claimed that while his NNPP is gaining momentum in the North, his Labour Party counterpart is only living on social media.  It reported that Kwankwaso had said that agreeing to be the running mate of Peter Obi would mean that his party, NNPP, a product of 32 years of political experience, which is gaining acceptance in the North, would die.  Amplifying Kwankwaso's earlier position, Galadima, a former member of the ruling All Progressives Congress and President Muhammadu Buhari's ally turned critic, claimed on Monday while featuring on Arise Television’s Morning Show that those calling for Kwankwaso to drop his presidential ambition to deputise Peter Obi are not politicians.  According to him, the Kwankwasian Movement has been in force for the past 32 years, while that of Peter Obi started just two months ago. He, therefore, stressed that there is no way the NNPP candidate can become Peter Obi’s running mate in the 2023 presidential election.  He said, “Those who said Chief Peter Obi could not be Kwankwaso’s running mate are not politicians. “They just started a movement two months ago while the Kwankwasian Movement has been on the ground for 32 years and the primary reason for the movement is for Kwankwaso to become President. “No Nigerian has ever performed well while in office like Alhaji Kwankwaso. I understand that Peter Obi was the governor of Anambra State and he did his best but not like Kwankwaso.”  He claimed that in terms of educational qualifications, Kwankwaso is more qualified than any other presidential candidate of any political party.
