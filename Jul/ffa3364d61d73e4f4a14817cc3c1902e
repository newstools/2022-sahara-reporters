Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer in the United States, has bagged a separate 21-year jail term for violating George Floyd's civil rights.According to TheGuardian, Chauvin was found guilty of this offence by a federal judge on Thursday. In June 2021, SaharaReporters reported that Chauvin was found guilty of murdering George Floyd, and he was sentenced to 22 years in prison.Chauvin, 45, was convicted in April on charges of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for his role in Floyd's death.All his jail terms will run concurrently and will see Chauvin moved to a federal prison.US district judge Paul Magnuson’s sentence came after Chauvin had agreed to a plea deal that called for a sentence ranging from 20 to 25 years.Federal prosecutors had sought the top end of that range, arguing that Chauvin, who is white, killed Floyd in cold blood when he pinned the Black man to the pavement outside a Minneapolis corner store on 25 May 2020, for more than nine minutes as Floyd pleaded that he could not breathe.Chauvin’s attorney had sought 20 years, arguing that Chauvin was remorseful.During Thursday’s hearing, Chauvin told Floyd’s family that he “wishes all the best” for Floyd’s children. But Chauvin’s brief remarks included no direct apology or expression of remorse to Floyd’s family.The plea deal called for Chauvin to serve the sentences at the same time and to be transferred from a Minnesota state prison to a federal prison, where experts say he likely will be safer and may be held under less restrictive conditions.
