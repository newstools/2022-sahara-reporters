Senator Shehu Sani has said Nigeria is currently at war with many terrorist groups who have been attacking several institutions and places in the country.  The former lawmaker who represented Kaduna Central in the Senate on Thursday via Twitter said Nigeria needs a leader, which invariably knocks President Muhammadu Buhari for incompetence.  Sani also dismissed the assertions of Buhari’s government that terrorists had been weakened in the country and reduced to only attacking soft targets.  According to Sani, the places attacked by the terrorists are not soft targets.  On Tuesday, some terrorists attacked Kuje Correctional Centre, freeing hundreds of inmates including Boko Haram fighters.  Sani tweeted, "The Attacks on military formations, Police Stations, Prisons, Election commission offices are attacks on symbols, institutions and pillars of the state. They are not soft targets. The nation is at war with multiples of organised guerrilla terror groups aiming at power. WE NEED A LEADER."  SaharaReporters earlier reported that the Islamic State-backed faction of Boko Haram, known as the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack on Kuje Correctional Centre in Abuja, the nation’s capital.  According to sources, the terrorists invaded the facility around 9:05 pm on Tuesday and operated till 1:30 am on Wednesday morning.  ISWAP in a video released on Wednesday claimed responsibility for the attack.  In the video, the terrorist group showed some of its men shooting their way into the facility.
