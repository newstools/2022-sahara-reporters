Some lawless policemen attached to the Ogombo Police Division in the Lagos State command have shot a member of the Nigerian Legion, Koleoso Abayomi, in the state. SaharaReporters gathered that the policemen accused Abayomi, a security officer at Lekki Scheme II Estate of delaying and denying them entrance into the estate.  The incident, multiple sources said, happened on Friday evening. The victim was said to have been brutalised for hours before one of the offices shot him in the thigh. “They wanted to get access to the estate of which the estate has its own policemen working with the legion officer inside the estate. “On their arrival, the legion officer told them to wait so that he could call the Chief Security Officer but the police men disagreed and started beating him. In the process, Koleoso was shot in the thigh,” a source said. The source added that the officers took the victim to a hospital and dropped him at the entrance. “They were forced by the people in the estate to take him to the hospital but since Friday that they took him to the hospital, they abandoned him there. This is so sad; policemen aren’t expected to behave like hoodlums,” another source noted.
