The presidential candidate of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), Mr. Dumebi Kachikwu, will tomorrow (Friday) unveil his running mate.Sources close to the Dumebi Kachikwu for President Campaign Organization, disclosed that the official unveiling is scheduled to take place in Abuja by noon barring last-minute changes. With the fresh information, Dr Mani Ahmad who was announced as Kachikwu's running mate in June could have been a placeholder all along. The National Chairman, Chief Ralph Okey Nwosu at the ADC's two-day retreat in Abuja in June said the party had found a ‘critical intellectual’ as a vice president for the country."We’ve had a good party arrangement, Dr Mani Ahmad has been put in place, he is a great party man and one of the critical intellectuals for nation building in Nigeria," he had said. But efforts to get the name of the proposed Vice Presidential nominee were not successful as Kachikwu is said to be keeping the information close to his chest pending the formal unveiling.“It is not a name I can tell you at this time. Our presidential candidate plans to disclose the name in a grand style tomorrow. So wait till you hear from the horse's mouth,” the source said. Another source however revealed that Kachikwu has selected a "dynamic, knowledgeable and experienced personality who shares his passion for impactful leadership and people-oriented service after his election as President". “All I can say is that the proposed running mate to the ADC’s presidential candidate is a well-groomed and knowledgeable Nigerian who would rightly complement Kachikwu's efforts in working to restore order, provide security, lift Nigerians out of poverty, fix the nation’s comatose infrastructure, curb corruption and painstakingly revive the economy.“Kachikwu means business and Nigerians, especially the youth, the under-served and neglected segments of the society will begin to understand his vision for a new Nigeria where the government exists solely to work for the security and welfare of the people after the grand unveiling tomorrow,” the source added.
