A group under the umbrella of Southern Kaduna New Faces has demanded 65 percent inclusion in the campaign organisation of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate in Kaduna State, Isa Ashiru, to promote equity and fairness. The group made the demand in a seven-point communiqué issued at the weekend shortly after a crucial meeting of the group over the emergence of Isa Ashiru and Dr. John Markus Ayuba as the PDP governorship candidate and running mate respectively in the forthcoming governorship election in Kaduna State, among other related matters.  The communiqué which was jointly signed by the group's chairman and secretary, Tanko Rossi Sabo and Barnabas Musa Chawai respectively also issued a two-week ultimatum to the PDP governorship candidate and his running mate, the state working committee of the PDP and other party leaders in the state to implement their demands, failure of which would force them to reconvene and redefine their political future. The communiqué explained that the Southern Kaduna New Faces is a coalition of concerned southern Kaduna youths with a shared vision of promoting and actualising the political, social, and economic interests of youths across the state. The group observed with dismay the process that led to the emergence of Dr. Ayuba for the deputy governorship role but noted that they have to accept the decision with pain because they do not have anything against his person. The meeting also demanded a revisit of the 2003 substantive power-sharing document signed between the northern and southern leaders of the party as the only condition for the party to get the southern Kaduna people’s bloc votes for the governorship election in 2023. They, however, pledged their loyalty and commitment to helping the PDP win the 2023 election.
