The Nigeria Police Force has detained the Chief Executive Officer of Rock FM Jalingo, Ayodele Oloye, at the Force Criminal Investigation Department, FCID, Abuja. It was gathered Oloye was detained because of a petition by the lawmaker representing the Taraba South Senatorial District, Senator Emmanuel Bwacha. Chief Executive Officer of Rock FM Jalingo, Ayodele Oloye Bwacha had earlier submitted a petition to the police to investigate the journalist in Taraba State over alleged cyber-stalling, defamation of character, and frustration of ambition among others. Daily Post reports that Ayodele had, prior to his detention, raised an alert in a text message forwarded to media colleagues on Monday morning. He said, “I’m Ayodele Samuel, Publisher of Taraba Truth and Facts Newspaper and CEO of Rock FM Jalingo, the first private FM radio station in Taraba State. “I’m honouring a police invitation at the FCID, Abuja over a petition (I don’t know who the petitioners are or the content of the petition) but as a law-abiding citizen, I have honoured the invitation with a lawyer provided by the Media Rights Agenda, MRA. “I feel it’s necessary to inform you and seek your support in case things go south.”
