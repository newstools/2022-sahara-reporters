Some Nigerians on Twitter have attacked billionaire oil mogul, Femi Otedola after he expressed his support for the presidential candidate of the All Progressive Congress, Ahmed Bola Tinubu.The businessman had shared a picture of himself standing beside the former Governor of Lagos State via Twitter, and prayed that God would grant Tinubu his heart desire to be Nigeria’s President in the 2023 election. The APC Presidential candidate is currently in France.Sharing the picture, Otedola had said it is always exciting to spend time with Tinubu, who he described as his great friend.“I am always excited visiting my Great Friend Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu,” Otedola tweeted on Tuesday.“May God grant him his heart’s desire in becoming the President of this great Nation. F.Ote.”The post however didn’t go well with some Twitter users, mostly supporters of the Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi.Below are some reactions from Twitter; Please respect yourself sir, just greet Ur friend and waka pass. We don't need sick people in Aso rock and we want competency. Or u still want Nigerian youths to continue asking ur daughter for urgent 2k giveaway.   OBI-dients fuming in the replies lol, you put an elite on a pedestal & get angry when they move like the humans they are; protecting personal interests & sticking to friends/acquaintances.Nigerian elites will always work for each other, our Job is to put one that works for usð¤·ð½ââï¸   Dear Femi Otedola, this man in this picture desires to be the CEO of any of your companies, please make his desire come through by employing him same way you want Tinubu to be president of Nigeria. pic.twitter.com/9YrEauIGWf   So you want other peopleâs children to go to the army and eat Agbado and cassava. Papa cuppy you do this one?   Itâs sad to see a man of this level of wealth and intellect with a terrible vision for Nigeria. But Iâve always understood that in order to amass wealth in a country like Nigeria, you must shake hands with devils. https://t.co/MauCAfKKIO   Otedola is fighting for a system that will work for him not minding if it will work for you. So please, work for a system that will work for you, my people. A system that will work for Otedola is not a system that will work for you, my people.   In supporting Peter Obi, understand the dynamics of how many elites work, esp Nigerian elites. They are friends & will protect their circles & interests. Femi Otedola has been friends with Tinubu forever. Politics wonât change that. Heâs protecting his interest. Protect yours. Dear Femi Otedola, @realFemiOtedolaIf Tinubu did you any favours in the past go and repay him however way you wishð. But you see that prayer you prayed for tinubu to be Nigeria's next president? It will not stand ! Nigerians are suffering and dying. We want a better country! Dear Otedola , you can afford relocate from 9ja if e cast, 98% of Nigerians canât afford that. Thatâs why that prayer of yours will never work. It will be cancelled by the prayer of majority of Nigerians. Fortunately,God does not look at pockets before answering prayers.
