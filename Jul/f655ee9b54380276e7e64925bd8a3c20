The National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Abdullahi Adamu, says he will give the performance of President Muhammadu-led administration pass in rating.  Adamu who accepted that there are increasing security challenges in the country, however, boasted that despite that his party with the control of 22 states out of 36 states of the Federation will still retain power in 2023.  The former governor of Nasarawa State who spoke while featuring on Arise TV programme to talk about APC’s chances in the 2023 general elections, said the insecurity in the country didn't start with his party.  He said, “As I speak to you, we have 22 (APC) states. And I don’t have a reason to believe that we are not going to win. I don’t contemplate any situation that can make us lose the election. But that’s not to say we don’t have to work for it. We are working for our victory and by the grace of God, victory will be ours in 2023.” He admitted that there were challenges with insecurity in the country but noted that President Muhammadu Buhari’s government was doing its best to address them. But despite the obvious failures of the APC government being led by Buhari. Adamu said he would give the President a pass mark or credit for his performance so far.  Adamu stated, “There’s no denying the fact that we face very serious security problems. There is no doubt about it. But if we are to be fair, the security challenges we are facing did not start with the administration of the APC.  “I will give him (Buhari) a pass mark. I repeat, I will give him pass mark or credit.”
