 Muslim Youth Forum of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), on Wednesday, stormed the party’s secretariat in Abuja in protest against the party’s choice of Kashim Shettima as the running mate to its presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu for the 2023 general elections.  The protesters who were at the APC National Secretariat in Abuja, said they decided to embark on the protest during the official unveiling of the former Borno State governor to register their grievances against the Muslim-Muslim ticket.  One of the protesters, Malam Abdullahi Bilal Muhammadu who spoke to The Punch said that the Forum was displeased with the APC’s decision which has exempted Christians in the North from politics at the federal level.  Muhammadu said, “We are here to register our grievances, to register our utter dismay with regards to the choice of party’s presidential candidate in the person of His Excellency, Senator Ahmed Bola Tinubu of deciding to run on a Muslim-Muslim ticket.  “We are here today to solidarize with our Christian brothers in the North who may have felt that they have exclusively been exempted from the scheme of affairs of the national polity.  “They contribute significantly here in Northern Nigeria. They have been their brothers’ keepers. They have been identifying with us in all our activities despite the fact that we are of a different faith.  “We deemed necessary and compelling that if Southern Nigeria is going to bring a Muslim ticket for us, then it is wise and rational for us, for the party, as well as youth party, because they have other Christians with credentials and leadership experience that are supposed to be running mate.  “We choose today because it is the official unveiling of the running mate and we felt that today, our grievances will reach the appropriate authority; and until the needful is done, we will continue to register our grievances to identify with our Christian brothers in the North to be on the ticket.”
