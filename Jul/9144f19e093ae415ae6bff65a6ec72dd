Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom has said that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is making efforts to resolve its internal crisis before the 2023 general elections. Ortom disclosed this while featuring on an Arise TV programme on Thursday, adding that the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar reached out to him to pacify Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike.  Nyesom has reportedly been unhappy with the manner by which he lost the presidential primaries of the PDP to Atiku and for being sidelined for Delta Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa as the vice-presidential candidate of the party for the 2023 election. Governor Ortom who has openly expressed support for Wike over the matter, expressed hope that Wike would work with Atiku to ensure that the party wins the next presidential election. Ortom noted that efforts were ongoing to “resolve the crisis in the party” “Our presidential candidate has reached out to me to pacify Wike. Wike stood with me at my worst time when my state was under siege. “I believe working with Wike will help get a better result. Once Wike is pacified, I will also be pacified. The issue is not about our personal interests but about Nigeria. “You will agree that Nigeria is under siege by a cabal that wants to enslave everybody,” he said. According to Ortom, they “need everybody to come together to see how we can rescue our country”.
