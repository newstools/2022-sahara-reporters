The Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission (ICPC) is set to arraign the President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) Amaju Pinnick, and the 2nd Vice President of the football body, Shehu Dikko in court over alleged corrupt practices.According to top sources, the ICPC has obtained the approval of the Presidency, after embarking on intensive investigations and it is now set to drag the duo to court over alleged corruption charges even as Pinnick plans to run for a 3rd term as the NFF President. Five other chieftains of the football body have various cases to answer following the recent development on various malpractices in the running of football in the country, a source said.“It has been established that NFF President, his second Vice President, Dikko, and five other top NFF officials have a case to answer after weeks of investigations by the ICPC.“This followed extensive investigations by the anti-corruption agency. The legal department of the ICPC is concluding plans to put up charges against Pinnick and other officials for them to face trial as soon as possible,” the source told The Nation.Although the offences of the football chiefs were not spelt out, it is believed that the ICPC is keeping this for strategic reasons.However, another source from the ministry, speaking with The Nation, said, “The football chieftains receive money appropriated to Nigeria Football Association and spend as Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) but turn around to say “interference” when they owe their existence and recognition because Government turns a blind eye to their illegal status and they still don’t want to obey the laws of the land.”
