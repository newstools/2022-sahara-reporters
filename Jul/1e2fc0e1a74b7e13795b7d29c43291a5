He studied Mathematics and was billed to start his graduate studies in Maritime studies on the 13th of September, 2022.The tragic incident comes 11 years after another son of the Appeal Court President, Samson Kwapda’as, was killed by a hit-and-run driver.The then 32-year-old student had graduated with a law degree from the University of Jos (UNIJOS), Plateau state, and had gone to the capital city to get his certificate.“I gave up sleep, hoping that my son will walk through the door and give me a big hug. I also left a plate of food on the table hoping he would return hungry,” Dongban-Mensem had told BBC in an interview.“My son wanted to be the best prosecutor in the world but died like a chicken on the street after being knocked down. He broke his two legs and neighbours within the area looked the other way as my son groaned in pain, bleeding from one end of the road to the other.“He gave up the ghost in the pool of his own blood but I am sure he would have survived if he was rushed to the hospital.”
