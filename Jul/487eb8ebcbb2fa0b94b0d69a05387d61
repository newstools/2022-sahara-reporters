Lasun Yusuff, the Labour Party governorship candidate in the July 16 Osun election says his house was in the early hours of Monday attacked by unidentified gunmen.  According to Yussuf in a Twitter post, the said building located in the Oke-Ima area of Ilobu came under attack around 2 am.  “Gunmen in uniforms are presently in my residence shooting sporadically,” he tweeted.  Yusuff, a former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives appeared on Sunday night at the Osun Governorship debate organised by Channels Television in Osogbo.  In May, Yusuf claimed he narrowly escaped being killed by some political thugs who allegedly attacked his convoy in Osogbo.  “All these ugly attacks on me personally and my campaign office point to the fact that my life and all others involved in my Gubernatorial Campaign in Osun are in serious danger,” he had said.  “Last week, some groups of political thugs abruptly stopped my convoy threatening and warning me of several planned attacks if we refuse to back down/stop our Gubernatorial Campaign. In fact, to put it straight, I was told point-blank that my life is in danger and that they will continue to trail me and also disrupt all my campaign activities and events anywhere in Osun State.  “At exactly 11 pm yesterday, some political thugs numbering about eight stormed my Campaign office at Oroki Estate barely thirty minutes after we all left for the day. They came with cutlasses, guns and other weapons and descended on my billboards, signposts and windows of the gatehouse destroying everything in sight.  “The Night Guard in panic came out to challenge them with all his might. He was, however, able to battle them causing them to run away. But this happened after they had destroyed everything outside the campaign office while the Night Guard’s resistance prevented them from gaining entrance to the Campaign Office.  “I, therefore, seize this opportunity to intimate the Public and the whole world that my political opponents have sponsored some thugs to be after my life and to disturb our Gubernatorial Campaign. The Security Operatives are hereby put on red alert in this respect.”
