He was unaware when he got to the office this morning that he would be leaving. He was expected to declare open a workshop at the NJI (National Judicial Institute). He was preparing for the conference when he read it somewhere that he has resigned.“The Presidency cabal waited to boot him out after Mary Odili retired. It is part of their plans for litigation ahead of 2023 elections,” one of the sources had told SaharaReporters.A source however told SaharaReporters that the Iseyin-born jurist has a terminal illness.“Do you know that Ariwoola is ill as well? He may leave soon on health grounds. That’s even if they send his name to the Senate for confirmation,” the source had said.“We pray he grows very old but because of his ill health, he may end up acting for a few months.”
