The Presidency has said that the incessant attacks by terrorists across Nigeria will not stop President Muhammadu Buhari from travelling abroad.This was stated by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, on Wednesday while responding to questions about why Buhari did not cancel his latest trip to Dakar, Senegal.  SaharaReporters earlier reported that President Buhari would depart Abuja Wednesday (today) to participate in the International Development Association (IDA) for Africa Summit in Dakar, Senegal.According to a statement by presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, an institution of the World Bank Group, IDA is deepening its support to drive a resilient recovery for countries hit by the global crises of climate and COVID-19, growing levels of insecurity and more recently, by the impact of the war in Ukraine through its historic $93 billion 20th replenishment cycle (IDA20) which goes into effect between July 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025.

“At the High Level event slated for Thursday, July 7 and hosted by President Macky Sall of the Republic of Senegal, President Buhari is expected to join other African leaders in an open Dialogue on Development Challenges and priorities as well as transformational initiatives that will lead to an outcome document, the Dakar Declaration,” the statement had read in part.The Nigerian President has been junketing worldwide in the last few months.Buhari’s latest trip comes less than 24 hours after terrorists attacked his convoy in Katsina State and the Kuje prison facility in Abuja, the nation’s capital.Also, two police officers were killed in the same Katsina, his home state, where the attack on the president’s convoy took place.A senior police officer was also killed in a separate state.The killing of the police officers comes after over 40 security personnel were killed by non-state actors last week.Responding to a question related to why the President was travelling overseas amid the worsening state of insecurity in the country, Adesina, who was at the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting, said: “The President should go (to Senegal) because there’s an international conference meant for heads of states and presidents; he should attend. You should never give in to terrorists. The moment terrorists begin to stop you from doing things, then we might as well throw up our hands in surrender. The President should go ahead. Yes, it’s an international obligation.”
