At least 77 children have been rescued by police officers from the basement of a church in Valentino area of Ondo town, Ondo State. SaharaReporters gathered that the victims include 25 children and 52 adults making a total of 77 people.  Speaking while being paraded at the police headquarters, along Igbatoro Akure, the Ondo State capital on Saturday, the Pastor in charge of the church, David Anifowose, said he received the instruction from God that they should camp in the church until his second coming. “I was the one that received the instruction from God that the people can stay in the church and wait for his second coming. And my members were waiting for the second coming of Jesus when the policemen invaded the church and arrested us.” One of the church members, Olasunkami Olafisoye, a 24 years old university graduate, said she disobeyed her parents because they were leading her away from God. Olafisoye said, “My parents are not attending the church again. When we left our former church, they usually stayed at home and before then, I am not comfortable with the Bible teaching of the church. “I later joined this church because my parent is leading me away from God and I want to make heaven. I love the way the church followed Jesus and the way they hold on to Christ.” This is coming few days after the Department of State Security (DSS) raided a house located at JMDB quarters, in the Tudun Wada community of Jos North LGA of Plateau State and rescued 21 young people, including almajirai. The victims alleged that they were forcefully brought to the house and converted to Christians. In April, the Ekiti police command also invited Nuah Abraham, the pastor of Christ High Commission Ministry, Kaduna State, for questioning over allegations of asking church members to pay N310,000 to prepare them for “rapture.” According to the police, Abraham had asked his church members to relocate from Kaduna to a camp in Araromi-Ugbesi in Omuo-Oke, Ekiti State.
