Consultations as to the political future of “jilted” Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, continued on Friday in Port Harcourt, as three governors of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) met with him. Governors Babajide Sanwo-Olu (Lagos), Oluwarotimi Akeredolu (Ondo), Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti) were among those who stormed the Ada George residence of their Rivers counterpart. The agenda of the visit was not made known to reporters, though it was clear that it was not unconnected to the 2023 general elections and the options available to Wike.The APC governors were said to have gone into a closed-door meeting with Wike shortly after their arrival.Sources close to Wike told Daily Trust that the visiting governors were led by former Governor of Ekiti State, Ayo Fayose.Fayose has been very vocal about the presidency returning back to the south.It has been rumoured that Wike has plans to defect to APC, having lost his bid to become Atiku’s presidential running mate.Meanwhile, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) National Chairman, Dr Iyorchia Ayu, has returned to the country after over two weeks break outside the country.Simon Imobo-Tswam, Ayu’s Special Assistant on Communication and Strategy, made the disclosure in a statement in Abuja on Friday.Ayu is coming back to the country as the crisis rocking the party over the choice of Delta State Governor Ifeanyi Okowa as the vice presidential candidate of the party for the 2023 elections continues to fester.According to the source, Ayu’s problem is now compounded in his absence as even some members of the Board of Trustee (BoT) and National Working Committee (NWC) are now divided into anti-and pro-Ayu groups.
