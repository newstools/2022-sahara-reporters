The presidential candidate of the African Action Congress, Omoyele Sowore, has asked Nigerian students affected by the strike action of the Academic Staff Union of Universities and their parents to join the protest action declared by the Nigeria Labour Congress. Sowore took to his Twitter page to advise the affected students to troop out en mass and join the protest.

Didn’t you see they’ve also increased petrol price to make life harder for you all?”‬ ASUU and the Nigerian government have been at loggerheads over the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System, a platform which the government said all lecturers must be registered on or they would not be paid salary. However, ASUU opposed the introduction of IPPIS as the payment platform, claiming that it did not take care of their peculiarities and insisted that they would rather use the University Transparency and Accountability Solution. The disagreement between both parties has led to the closure of all government universities for the last five months. NLC in a circular last week declared a two-day nationwide protest in solidarity with the striking lecturers. The circular dated July 15, was signed by the National President of the NLC, Ayuba Wabba, and issued to all the state chairmen of the union. According to the circular, the protest would be held on “Tuesday, July 26, 2022, and Wednesday, July 27, 2022, in all the states of the Federation and Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory. “Take-off point is the NLC State Secretariats and the Labour House, Abuja. You are requested to immediately convene the meetings of your SAC to disseminate this information and to fully mobilise workers in the states for this very important protest for good governance,” it added.
