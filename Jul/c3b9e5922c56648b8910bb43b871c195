President Muhammadu Buhari has visited the Kuje Correctional Centre in Abuja, the nation’s capital hours after a terrorist attack on the prison facility. SaharaReporters earlier reported that terrorists suspected to be members of Jamar Ansarul Muslimina fi Biladi Sudan, popularly known as Ansaru attacked the facility on Tuesday night and freed inmates, including their members and Boko Haram terrorists held in custody during the attack.  Though the Nigeria Correction Service’s spokesperson, Umar Abubakar, said one Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps officer and four inmates died during the incident, a source told SaharaReporters that 10 inmates were killed during the incident. Another source also dismissed the claim by the Minister of Defence, Bashir Magashi, that 64 Boko Haram members escaped, adding that over 201 members of the group were currently unaccounted for.
