The Zamfara State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party has opposed Governor Bello Matawalle’s directive to the people of the state to bear arms and defend themselves. The state secretary of the party, Faruku Ahmed, at a press conference, said the decision to allow people to bear arms could lead to anarchy and political vendetta against the opposition parties, according to Punch. Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara-state Ahmed maintained that it was the sole responsibility of both the state and federal governments to protect the lives and property of the citizenry. He said, “Although the security issue is everybody’s business, to secure the lives and property is the responsibility of any government on earth.” “As peace-loving and law-abiding citizens, we fault Zamfara State and the Federal Government for shifting such constitutional responsibility to ordinary citizens.” “That it has been clear that the security agencies, groups and legal experts within and outside the state have opposed the firearms acquisition.” Ahmed added, “The ruling APC administration’s failure has left Governor Bello Matawalle with no option but to manipulate the insecurity situation within the state to witch-hunt opposition parties in the state. “As such, the PDP perceived the exercise as a deliberate attempt to divert public resources.” The PDP Secretary, therefore, called on the security agents to stop Governor Matawalle from his dangerous plan of allowing people to bear arms. “We are calling on the Inspector-General of police, the DSS and the NSCDC to be eagle eye on the ill-intention of targeting the opposition parties using various security committees established by Zamfara State government because the approach seems to be so tricky.”
