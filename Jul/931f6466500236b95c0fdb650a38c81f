The newly-created Lagos State Parking Authority (LASPA) has taken over open parking spaces in the state. LASPA was established in 2021 and headed by Adebisi Adelabu, as General Manager.  The government had claimed it created the agency to enforce parking violations and offences in the state. In a document seen by SaharaReporters, park operators (commercial) were asked to pay to between N2million and N23million annually, depending on the location as “license” fee. SaharaReporters learnt that the government had started serving notices of trespass on landmarks that were not on government roads. “The Lagos State government has commenced exploration of off street parking lots operators again under the state's illegal LASPA agency,” a resident said.
