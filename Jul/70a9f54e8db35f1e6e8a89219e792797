The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar has said that the Labour Party lacks the structure required to win the 2023 presidential election in the country. Peter Obi, who was Atiku’s running mate in the 2019 presidential election is the presidential candidate of the Labour Party for the next election.  According to Atiku during an interview on Arise TV on Friday, which was monitored by SaharaReporters, although the Labour Party claims to have over 1 million votes for last Saturday’s Osun governorship election on social media, the party’s votes after the counting didn’t justify the claim. He said, “I really don’t expect the Labour Party to take as much votes from the PDP as people are suggesting, we have seen it in the last election in Osun State. “What’s the performance of the Labour Party? This is a party that doesn’t have a governor, doesn’t have members of the National Assembly, and doesn’t have state assembly members. And politics in this country depends on the structures you have at these various levels at the local, state and at the national level, so it is very difficult to expect a miracle to happen simply because Peter Obi is in the Labour Party.  “After all they were saying through the social media; they have more than one million votes in Osun State but how many turned up to vote for Labour Party?” Atiku also said, “In the North, 90 percent of the people are not on social media.”
