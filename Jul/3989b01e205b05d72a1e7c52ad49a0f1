Ahead of the February 2023 general elections in Nigeria, some Presidential candidates have petitioned the United States of America, United Kingdom and the international community over alleged posting of top police officers in favour of the South-West region. They alleged the posting was done to help the candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu rig the poll.  Tinubu is from the South-West Region of the country. According to them, the Chairman of the Police Service Commission (PSC), Musiliu Smith, has approved the posting of 16 indigenes who hail from the South-West to serve as commissioners out of the 37 commands in the country - 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory. The petitioners alleged that Smith, who is a former Inspector-General of Police (IGP) and from the South-West carried out the lopsided postings in collaboration with the present IGP, Usman Alkali Baba, who is from Yobe State, in North-East Nigeria. Also approved are the postings of seven Assistant Inspectors General (AIGs) of Police who are from of the South-West to seven out of the 17 zonal headquarters, the petitioners alleged. “We considered these postings as a plot to rig the 2023 presidential election using the relationship between the APC and the two top police officials,” the petition read. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said the Presidential and National Assembly elections will hold on Saturday, February 25, 2023, while governorship and state houses of assembly elections will hold on March 11, 2023.
