Yesufu, who asked Governor Obaseki if he is not concerned about the monstrous activities of criminals in the state, lamented that despite the alarming rate of kidnappings and killings in the state, the Obaseki-led government has failed to address them.She wrote, “The insecurity in Edo State is on a high level but @GovernorObaseki is busy speaking Queen's English from one conference to another. “Kidnapping and killing of kidnapped victims is at an alarming rate. Yet torchlight is not being focused on it.“Is the Governor concerned?”
