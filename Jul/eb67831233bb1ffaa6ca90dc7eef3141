The opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has accused the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) of importing hoodlums into Ifewara and Ilesha areas to disrupt the ongoing governorship election in Osun State.The PDP which made the accusation on its official Twitter page called on its leaders, agents and electorates to be aware of the alleged development, while calling on security agents to take note. It said, “To all our party leaders, agents and electorates in Ifewara, Ilesha, we have been made aware that the failed @OfficialAPCNg has imported thugs from neighbouring states to the LGA to perpetrate violence. @PoliceNG, other security agents, pls take note.”Across Osun State today, up to 1,955,657 registered voters are expected to exercise their franchise across the 3,763 polling units to elect a new governor for the state in a keen contest.Soldiers, policemen and members of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) have been sighted in strategic locations around the state capital and border towns.The election, which will be contested by 15 political parties, is expected to be a straight duel between the incumbent governor, Gboyega Oyetola of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Senator Ademola Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).Other candidates in the race are the former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Lasun Yusuf of the Labour Party, Goke Omigbodun of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and Akin Ogunbiyi of Accord Party.More voters are expected to participate in the election than the 2018 poll when 767,444 electorates out of the 1,668,524 registered voters exercised their franchise. The election recorded 45.99 per cent turnout.In 2018, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declared Oyetola as winner, having polled 255,505 votes against Adeleke, who had 255,023 votes at the end of a supplementary election, which held in seven polling units across four local governments amidst allegations of harassment and other forms of malpractice.The INEC had scheduled the rerun after declaring the main election inconclusive, won by Adeleke with 353 votes after polling 254,698 against Oyetola’s 254,345. It stated that the margin of votes between Adeleke and Oyetola was less than the number of cancelled votes in seven polling units.
