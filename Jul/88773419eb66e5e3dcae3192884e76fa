The alleged killing of a 15-year-old boy by members of the Enugu State Vigilante Group in Nkpologwu community in the Uzo-Uwani Local Government Area of the state has triggered violence in the area.  SaharaReporters reliably gathered on Friday morning that several houses had been burnt. It was learnt that residents were fleeing the community in droves.  Sources said that trouble started when the vigilantes stormed the residence of the late Chukwuka on Wednesday night to arrest.  According to the source, the move to arrest Chukwuka followed a disagreement over a land-related issue in the market earlier in the day.  The victim (deceased) allegedly resisted arrest and in the process, he was shot in the waist by one of the vigilantes. He reportedly died the next day, Thursday.  The source said news of his death immediately triggered violent demonstrations across the community.  An eyewitness, who spoke to SaharaReporters on condition of anonymity, said the death of the boy angered the youths who went on a rampage, burning houses belonging to members of the group.  “We’re currently living in fear because we don’t know what will happen next and we’re helpless.  “As I speak with you now, the house of the Chief Security Officer, CSO of our local government, Barr. Chijioke Ezugwu has been completely burnt down.  “The house of a businessman, Anthony Ani was torched and this arson is spreading by the day. We call on the relevant authorities to rise up and save our agrarian community before the situation goes out of hand completely,” the source said.  In another narrative, the victim was allegedly selling methamphetamine, popularly known as 'Mkpurumiri' which reportedly prompted the move by the vigilantes to arrest him.  But unfortunately, he was killed in the process.
