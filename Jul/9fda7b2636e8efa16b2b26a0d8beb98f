Seven personnel of the Nigerian Army have been reportedly killed by suspected terrorists in the Karim-Lamido Local Government Area of Taraba State. The soldiers were killed by terrorists in a forest around the Amdami area in Karim Lamido on Thursday night when they were on patrol within the area.  The council of chairman of Karim Lamido, Markus Hamidu, also confirmed the incident, Daily Post reports. He said, “Seven soldiers were killed by bandits yesterday (Thursday) around Amdami area. It is very unfortunate. May God save us.” Though the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in the state, Usman Abdullahi, could not be reached for comment, as he was said to be on Hajj to the Muslim Holy land, a senior policeman, who pleaded anonymity, confirmed the incident. Other sources from the council lamented the spate of killings and kidnappings that had been going on in the area, adding that the terrorists had taken over all the available spaces in the forest surrounding the council. SaharaReporters earlier reported that a serving lawmaker representing Taraba South Senatorial District, Emmanuel Bwacha (APC), confirmed that over 40 persons were killed during the Sallah break by terrorists in the southern part of Taraba State. He said the assailants entered his constituency with motorbikes, popularly known as Okada, and killed the people, including the soldiers and police officers mobilised to avert the attack. Another lawmaker who corroborated this information at the plenary on Wednesday was a member representing Wukari/Ibi Federal Constituency of Taraba State in the House of Representatives, Danjuma Shiddi. Shiddi said the village was razed by the rampaging bandits who maimed and displaced hundreds of locals. He said many communities in Takum had come under heavy attacks by bandits, the latest being the Tuesday attack on Tati village during which the six soldiers and a policeman were killed.
