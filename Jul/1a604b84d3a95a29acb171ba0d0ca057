Suspected terrorists on Sunday killed a driver with the Katsina State Transport Authority (KTSTA), Nasiru Yusha’u, after the victim’s vehicle ran into the gunmen along the Katsina-Jibia Road.  A resident of Daddara village close to the scene of the incident told Channels TV that the bus was attacked around noon on Sunday.  He said Yusha’u saw the gunmen and attempted to turn around but the terrorists caught up with him and shot him dead. After killing the driver, the terrorists reportedly stole mobile phones, money and other valuables from the passengers. The 32-seater bus occupied predominantly by traders was on its way from Jibia Market to Katsina when the terrorists opened fire on them, eyewitnesses said. The General Manager of Katsina State Transport Authority, Haruna Musa Rugoji has also confirmed the incident. He disclosed that the deceased took passengers from Katsina to Jibia. Then, from Jibia also, he took passengers to Katsina and it was during the return trip that the incident took place at Farun Bala. “The driver was trying to turn the vehicle with the passengers when he saw the four bandits crossing the road at that particular community. They shot him dead. Maybe they thought that he would go back and give information.  “There was no kidnapping intention by the bandits because they didn’t kidnap anybody. They only shot the driver and collected cash and some phones from the passengers. It wasn’t a target. “I went to the scene and I was among those that took the corpse from the scene to General Hospital Katsina now to Musawa, the hometown of the deceased, for burial,” he said.
