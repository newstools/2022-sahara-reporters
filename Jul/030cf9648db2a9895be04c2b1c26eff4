Barrister Aloy Ejimakor, the Special Lawyer to the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, has accused the President Muhammadu Buhari-led Nigerian government of pampering terrorists but killing unarmed Igbos without hesitation under the guise of fighting separatism.Ejimakor made the remark on his Twitter page while lamenting the persistent extrajudicial killings in the South-East by operatives and personnel of Nigerian security agencies including the Nigerian Army. Ejimakor in a tweet on Wednesday morning wrote, “FYI: As the  extrajudicial killings in SE continue, every true #Igbo (elites & masses alike) is personally bereaved anytime an Igbo life is taken by a Nigerian state that pampers rank terrorists but is too quick to kill the unarmed Igbo in the guise of fighting separatism.”Recall that SaharaReporters recently reported how military officers stormed some communities in the Ogbaru Local Government Area in Anambra State and killed over a dozen of youths whom they labelled members of the Indigenous People Of Biafra and operatives of the Eastern Security Network (ESN).Ejimakor in his reaction to the killing and the outcry of the people in the communities and the South-East in general described the killings as a show of ethnic imbalance within the security formations in the region.The IPOB leader’s Special Counsel therefore called on the people of the South-East region to unite against such ethnic imbalance that had left the region vulnerable; as he lamented that the region was gradually being taken over by security men driven by sectarian impulses.
