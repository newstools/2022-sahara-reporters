Sources close to the party’s governorship candidate and the leadership of the party confirmed the development to Daily Trust, saying that she would be unveiled soon, adding that “it has not been announced officially.” The newspaper had reported that Akindele was shortlisted among the former governorship aspirant, Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour; former Senatorial candidate for Lagos East, Yeye Shobajo, another governorship aspirant, David Kolawole Vaughan and Engr.
