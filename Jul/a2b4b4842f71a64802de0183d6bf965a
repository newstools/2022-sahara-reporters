A Federal High Court in Abuja has ordered the Nigeria Immigration Service and others to release the official details of David Nwamini to former Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, Channels reports.  Recall that Ekweremadu and his wife, Beatrice, were arrested last week by the London Metropolitan Police for allegedly conspiring to bring a child to the UK for organ harvesting.  The couple was tried at the Uxbridge Magistrates’ Court in London and denied bail as the prosecutors claimed that David Ukpo Nwamini, the victim who alleged that he was coerced to donate his kidney to the Senator’s daughter, is said to be 15 years old.  However, there have been contrary claims that Ukpo is 21 years old.  The case has been adjourned to July 7 at Westminster Magistrate Court to enable the UK Attorney General, Suella Braverman, to determine whether the case will be tried in the country or Nigeria.  Meanwhile, the Nigerian government through the High Commission to the United Kingdom engaged lawyers to defend Ekweremadu, a statement by Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, noted.  He said the decision to wade into Ekweremadu’s arrest and detention was against the backdrop of a briefing received by the Nigerian High Commissioner to London.  “I had a personal engagement with our Nigerian High Commissioner to Britain, Alhaji Isola Sarafa, who has done so well to establish contact with our colleague, who has been able to get his team to be in the court at Uxbridge where Ekweremadu was taken to,” the statement read.
