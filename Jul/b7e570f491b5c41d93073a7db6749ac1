The Presidential Candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, will on Wednesday officially present the former governor of Borno State, Senator Kashim Shettima, as his running mate for the 2023 general elections. This is however coming despite nationwide criticisms and rejection of the choice of Tinubu and the leadership of the APC to go with Muslim-Muslim ticket.  For over a week since the former Lagos State and national leader of the party picked Shettima as his running mate, many members, especially some lawmakers and other leaders of the ruling party have not only faulted the Muslim-Muslim ticket but have dumped the party, while groups, opinion leaders and the Christian community have largely condemned the party’s choice, describing it as insensitivity to principle of inclusiveness, equity and fairness. However, a statement released on Tuesday morning by the APC National Organising Secretary, Suleiman Argungu, stated that Shettima will be officially presented by 1pm at the Shehu Musa Yar’Adua Centre in Abuja. “The All Progressives Congress will formally unveil its Vice Presidential Candidate, Senator Kashim Shettima, to the Nigerian public. “All members of the National Executive Committee, Progressives Governors’ Forum, APC Caucus in the National Assembly, Federal Executive Council, diplomatic corps and presidential aspirants at the June 2022 Special National Convention, APC state chairmen, secretaries and organising secretaries are hereby invited to witness this landmark official unveiling of our great party’s vice presidential candidate,” part of the statement read. Recall that after a closed door meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari on July 10 in Daura, Katsina State, Tinubu had told journalists that Shettima was the “chosen one.”
