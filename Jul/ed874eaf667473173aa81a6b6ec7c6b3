The Nigeria Army has deployed its personnel to mount roadblocks in some major locations in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).Last Tuesday, ISWAP terrorists attacked Kuje Correctional Centre, freeing hundreds of inmates, including Jihadists held at the prison facility. On Friday, the Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS) revealed the names and photos of some of the inmates who escaped from the correctional facility following the attack.One of the suspected terrorists who escaped during the invasion, Hassan Hassan, was recently recaptured in Nasarawa State.Another fugitive, Sidi, was arrested on Monday by the NDLEA at the Area 1 motor park in Abuja while attempting to board a commercial vehicle to Maiduguri, Borno State.The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) had raised the alarm over planned attacks by the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP) terrorists on selected targets in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.It also said that the Islamic terrorists had declared war against Christians in Nigeria, saying that was why they attacked the Kuje Correctional Centre and released some of their fighters to sustain the attack.NSCDC disclosed this in letter with Ref: No; NSCDC/CMDT/FCT/INT/VOL.X/188 addressed to the Permanent Secretary, Federal Capital Territory Administration and was by FCT Commandant, Peter Maigari.However, the current situation in Abuja had left many pedestrians in the heavy traffic on the Abuja-Keffi Road on Sunday night following a roadblock mounted by soldiers stationed opposite Mogadishu Barracks, otherwise, called Abacha Barracks.The barricade caused gridlock that morphed from the Nyanya bound side of the barracks to as far as AYA bridge.The traffic has also caused many vehicles heading towards Nyanya, Mararaba, Karu, New Karu, Keffi, and Jos among other places, to be trapped on the road into the early hours of yesterday.According to ThisDay, soldiers had set up barriers in Madalla on the Zuba-Abuja-Kaduna express road in their hunt for some of the Kuje prison escapees, who might contemplate infiltrating Niger, Kaduna and Nasarawa states that border the FCT.
