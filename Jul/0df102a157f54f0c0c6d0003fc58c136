Following the poor state of the Government Girls’ Secondary School in Kaiama, in the Kolokuma-Opokuma council area of Bayelsa state where students sit on the bare floor, the state governor, Douye Diri has finally woken to his responsibilities by ordering the school to move to a new site. A statement by the commissioner for information and orientation, Ayiba Duba said the viral picture showing pupils of the school taking a class while seated on the floor as shared by concerned citizens prompted the action.  According to Duba, the state government was not aware of the poor condition of the school. Duba said, “The attention of Bayelsa State Government has been drawn to a picture of the Government Girls’ Secondary School Kaiama on the social media and the concerns it raised. “This prompted the immediate on-the-spot assessment of the situation by the Commissioner for Education, Dr. Gentle Emelah. “For the avoidance of doubt, Government is not unaware of the condition of our schools and a holistic plan of action is being implemented to revamp them. “This explains why the government is committing huge resources to several ongoing renovations and reconstruction of existing schools’ infrastructure and construction of new ones. “The case of the Government Girls’ Secondary School Kaiama is particularly pathetic because the school is susceptible to perennial flooding which often results in damage of facilities and equipment in the school.” “While the state government will continue to implement the ongoing reconstruction of infrastructure in a phased and systematic manner within the limit of available resources, the Governor, His Excellency, Senator Douye Diri has directed that the Government Girls’ Secondary School Kaiama be relocated to a new site and provided with new facilities. The Ministry of Education is already implementing the directive,” the commissioner added.
