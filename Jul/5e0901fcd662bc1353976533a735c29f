Gunmen suspected to be Islamic terrorists masquerading as herdsmen have reportedly kidnapped over 15 residents of Mgbuji Eha-Amufu Community in the Isi-Uzo local government area of Enugu State. The invasion of the community and abduction of the residents occurred on Monday morning. SaharaReporters Media The kidnap, it was gathered took place around 7 am along Mgbuji-Agu Road near the Railway crossing within Mgbuji town.  Sources told SaharaReporters that some of the villagers were going to their farms on tricycles when the terrorists seized them, while others were picked up on their various rice farms.  The invading terrorists were said to have driven towards the Benue State border with Enugu after the abductions.  The spokesman for Mgbuji Community, Chijioke Ogbodo, who confirmed the abductions on Monday, lamented that soldiers recently deployed to Eha-Amufu failed to act and allegedly refused to answer distress calls.  He called on the state government to do something to rescue the victims, adding that their offence was trying to get something to eat from their farms.  SaharaReporters had reported that gunmen suspected to be Islamic terrorists in police and military uniforms on July 5, kidnapped seven residents of the same community and shot three others.  The community and other neighbouring communities in Eha-Amufu have been witnessing several attacks since September 2021. Many people have been killed, and hundreds of houses and property worth millions of naira have been destroyed. So many others have been kidnapped for ransom.  Meanwhile, efforts by SaharaReporters to get the reaction of Enugu State Police Command were not successful.  The Command's spokesman DSP Daniel Ndukwe, did not pick up his mobile phone when SaharaReporters called him for comments and clarifications.
