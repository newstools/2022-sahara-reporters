Dr Usman Galadima, Chief of Operations and Head of the Nigerian Medical Mission, confirmed to newsmen that no cause had been ascertained for her death. He said that the family of Aminu had already been informed of her death and she would be buried according to Islamic rites. Aminu is the second Nigerian pilgrim that died during the 2022 Hajj operations. Hajiya Aisha Ahmed from Keffi in Nasarawa State died last week during a brief illness and was buried in Makkah. The stay on Arafat throughout the day is a compulsory rite for each pilgrim to perform Hajj. Nigerian pilgrims were among the over one million performing the 2022 Hajj operations in Arafat. The Arafat is the place where Prophet Muhammed delivered his last sermon on a Friday prior to his death.
