The Nigerian Air Force authorities have paid officers studying at the Air Force Institute of Technology in Kaduna State their Ration Cost Allowance (RCA). According to the Manual of Financial Administration of Armed Forces of Nigerian (2017), military students under Nigerian Air Force sponsorship are entitled to RCA daily.  SaharaReporters on June 29 reported that the officers had not received their allowances in the last seven months. SaharaReporters had also published the grievances of the soldiers who claimed that the development demonstrated their superiors’ insensitivity to their enormous sacrifices for the country. Some of the personnel also said that the situation was causing them hunger and depleting their morale.
