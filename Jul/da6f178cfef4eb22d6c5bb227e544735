The Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) has called for the immediate disbanding of Ebube Agu Security outfit in Imo State over what it called an atrocious murder committed by them under the watch of Governor Hope Uzodinma.While condemning the killing of 14 defenceless youths from Otulu town who were returning from a traditional marriage, MASSOB said the Ebube Agu operatives had not engaged marauding terrorists and herdsmen who had sacked so many villages and settlements but they were instead killing innocent youths. MASSOB in a statement issued by Uchenna Madu, on Tuesday, said the killings in Otulu community were one of the several secret killings of "our people by Governor Hope Uzodinma-backed Ebubeagu.” The statement partly read, "They are primarily established as a witch-hunting outfit to fight political enemies and non-violent pro-Biafra agitators. MASSOB described Ebube Agu security outfit as a dracula evil and agents of death established by the Imo State Government."MASSOB warns Governor Hope Uzodinma to immediately disband his Ebubeagu security outfit now or we shall see their activities in Biafra land as a declaration of internal war. The so-called Ebubeagu security outfit must cease their operation in Imo State now."
