Most of the 700 inmates at the Kuje correctional facility in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory have escaped, SaharaReporters has learnt. SaharaReporters also learnt that other inmates have been removed from the facility including the suspended deputy commissioner of police, Abba Kyari, who was remanded at the prison by a Federal High Court.  Kyari is standing trial for allegedly dealing in cocaine alongside four members of his former police unit, the Inspector-General of Police Intelligence Response Unit (IRT), and two other persons arrested at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport in Enugu, Enugu State, in January this year. Gunmen suspected to be terrorists on Tuesday night attacked the prison facility in Nigeria's capital city, and SaharaReporters learnt that the facility was ruined by the heavy firepower brought by the assailants. Multiple sources told SaharaReporters that the gunmen invaded the facility around 10 pm.
