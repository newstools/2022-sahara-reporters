A Nigerian car dealer, Omowalyn, bought cars from a United States-based Green Light Auto Transport in April 2020 but has neither received the cars nor a refund of the money paid for the goods.SaharaReporters learnt that the Nigerian, owner of Omowalyn Nigeria Limited, bought the cars from the US firm located at 6905 PITTS Road, Jacksonville, FL 32219 United States. Omowalyn told SaharaReporters that one of the transactions which was at auction base was for the Green Light Auto Transport to pick the car and ship to Nigeria.On that background, the buyer requested a refund of the money paid for the car but Green Light Auto Transport ignored messages sent to them by Omowalyn Nig Ltd till date.“I bought a vehicle at auction and I told them to pick the vehicle and help me to ship the vehicle to Nigeria since April 2020 and after they picked the car, they told me the vehicle was lost.“I have been prevailing on them to refund me and they didn’t reply to any messages I sent to them again,” Omowalyn Nig Ltd told SaharaReporters.Omowalyn also said that Green Light also shipped four vehicles to them in the same 2020 but three of the vehicles got burnt on the vessel and till date, the US company had not replaced the vehicles as they had been saying that their insurance company did not pay for the burnt vehicles.“The same company helped me to ship 4 (four) vehicles in the same 2020 and 3 (four) vehicles got burnt on the vessel and up till now they are telling me insurance has not paid for the burnt vehicle.”From the details of the transactions seen by SaharaReporters, the vehicles include 2005 Toyota Corolla Gray colour sold at the sum of $2,238.
