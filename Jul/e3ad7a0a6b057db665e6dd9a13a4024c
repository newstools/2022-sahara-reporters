A chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Daniel H. Bwala has resigned his membership of the party over its choice of a Muslim-Muslim Presidential ticket for the 2023 general elections.  Bwala announced his resignation from the party on Sunday night amid wide condemnation and rejection that trailed the party’s announcement of the former governor of Borno State, Senator Kashim Shettima, as the running mate of the APC’s presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu.  “Tonight, I officially resigned my membership of @OfficialAPCNg on principles and conviction that I hold so dear. At this time of our national existence, our efforts and energy should gravitate towards uniting our people,” Bwala wrote on his Twitter page.  Many Nigerians, especially members of opposition parties have criticised the ruling party over its Muslim-Muslim ticket, with some describing it as “terrible” and an indication of the party’s “insensitivity” to the current situation in the country.  Some critiques of the APC’s Muslim-Muslim ticket choice have also said that the party is insensitive to Nigeria’s religious composition and argued that it is capable of igniting religious dichotomy in the country.
