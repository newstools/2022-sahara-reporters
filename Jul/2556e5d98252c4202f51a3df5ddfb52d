Rev. Fr. Johnmark Cheitnum, one of the two Catholic priests recently kidnapped in Kaduna has been found dead on a farm in a nearby village.  Fr. Cheitnum was abducted alongside his colleague, Rev. Fr. Donatus Cleopas from Christ the King Catholic Church in the Lere Local government area of the state last Friday.  The priests were abducted after they arrived for a parish function at the church, according to the Kaduna Diocese. But a report by TVC News said the security operatives who were on a rescue mission confirmed that they found the lifeless body of a man on a farm in a nearby village. The remains have been deposited at a morgue in Zonkowa.  Meanwhile, the security operatives suspect that the cleric might have been killed by his abductors, while they confirmed that the second victim, Fr. Cleopas has regained freedom.  Fr. Cleopas, who reportedly regained freedom about 30 minutes after the dead body of his colleague was found, was said to have been taken to the Kafachan Catholic in Jema’a Local Government Area.  However, the Kaduna State Police Command has yet to make an official statement on the incident.
