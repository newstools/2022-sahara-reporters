The Tiv Youth Council Worldwide has lambasted Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State for calling on the Nigerian government to release the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu.  Governor Ortom on Thursday asked the Nigerian government to release the IPOB leader as part of the peace-building effort in the country, describing Kanu's issue as a socio-political challenge that should be dealt with politically.  According to Ortom, if President Muhammadu Buhari’s government could release Boko Haram terrorists to reintegrate them into society, why should Nnamdi Kanu continue to languish in detention. But reacting to the call in Abuja, the president of the Tiv Youth group, Mike Msuaan, asked the governor to immediately return home from his trip abroad to pay the pensions and salaries of his state’s pensioners and workers respectively. “It is worrying that a governor who has been unable to meet minor demands of governance like paying workers and pensioners benefits for several months is on globe gallivanting venture.  “The photo sessions with citizens of United Kingdom will not translate to good governance in the state. It will not return the hundreds of thousands of people living in IDP camps back to their homes.  “Second-term governors are busy commissioning legacy and life-changing projects for their people while in the absence of any, Governor Ortom is issuing press statements to be featured on newspaper headlines.  “Governor Ortom must return home and live with the problems he has created in the state,” he said.
