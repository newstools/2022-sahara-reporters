The Nigerian Senate, through the Public Accounts Committee, has disclosed that it will issue a warrant of arrest against the Interim Administrator of the Presidential Amnesty Programme (PAP), Colonel Milland Dixon Dikio (retd.), over alleged failure of the agency to account for N10billion.The committee chairman, Senator Matthew Urhogbide, made this move because of the failure of Dikio to honour several invitations sent to him to respond to the allegations. It was gathered that the committee had invited the PAP’s Interim Administrator to appear before it to respond to queries against the agency contained in the 2018 Report of the Auditor General of the Federation.According to The Nation, the agency’s Interim Administrator was scheduled to appear on February 3, 2022, according to an invitation letter, dated January 25, 2022.Similarly, in another letter, officials of the agency were expected to appear on June 16, 2022, following an invitation, dated May 19, 2022.The agency was also billed to appear before the committee on July 5, 2022, following a letter of invitation, dated June 28, 2022, but failed.The AuGF’s query reads: “Audit observed that N324,969,190.00 was paid to some members of staff vide six payment vouchers for hosting ex-agitators, 150 leaders of ex-agitators, and logistics for various trainings, etc, in 2015 financial year."However, these vouchers and attached supporting documents revealed that the payments were made into single person’s accounts on behalf of other beneficiaries in contravention of the aforementioned provisions.“In the same vein, payment vouchers were raised and paid for N3,465,713,500.00 in the 2016 financial year as monthly stipends to ex-agitators in various camps.“These payments were made without due recourse to the e-payment policy of the Federal Government where the amount should have been paid direct to the accounts of the beneficiaries.“This may lead to diversion of public funds for purposes other than intended."
