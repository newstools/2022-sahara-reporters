The presidential candidate of the African Action Congress (AAC), Mr Omoyele Sowore has mocked the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Mr Peter Obi for visiting former President Olusegun Obasanjo and former dictator, Ibrahim Babangida to seek their support. Sowore posted two photographs – one showing Obi and his running mate, Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed standing on either side of Obasanjo, to support the aged former President.  A second photograph shows Obi seated beside Babangida. The AAC presidential candidate criticised Obi’s visits to the two former leaders, tweeting, "Our quest for a new and radical leadership is rooted in a total rejection of the old crooked & criminal order! #WeCantContinueLikeThis.”  Last week, Sowore also criticised Obi for visiting Babangida a former dictator and military the former dictator who is notorious for annulling the June 12, 1993 election – which was popularly won by the late Chief MKO Abiola. Babangida, known as the "evil genius" was the head of the Nigerian military government from 1985 to1993. “Olusegun Obasanjo, Ibrahim Babangida, Aliyu Gusau, Abubakar Abdusalam and Ango Abdullahi are Mr. Peter Obi’s “God fathers” the people that ruined Nigeria are the ones fronting for him. May it never happen that we will work with these criminals! #WeCantContinueLikeThis,” Sowore had captioned the picture shared last week.
