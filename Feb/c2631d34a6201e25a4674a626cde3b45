The Governor of Oyo State, Seyi Makinde says Muslims in the state can be assured of the protection of their religious rights.  This was contained in a statement issued by the Governor's Special Assistant on Islamic Affairs, Abdulrasheed Abdazeez, to mark the 2022 World Hijab Day. Seyi Makinde “Hijab is a covering which not only beautifies the wearer but also helps in advancing decency in the society,” NAN quoted him as saying.  The governor congratulated the Muslim Ummah in the state, especially the female adherents and pledged that his administration would not oppose activities and practices that would promote godliness and modesty.  “Muslim students who wish to wear hijab in public schools in Oyo State have not been denied their right to do so.  “I have instructed those in positions of authority in the state’s public service and across all our public schools not to intimidate or harass anyone because of their religious beliefs or practices.  “Our government is God-fearing and we will continue to preach religious tolerance, equality and justice, which will further engender peaceful coexistence, love and togetherness.  “As the theme of this year’s celebration suggests, hijab is the pride of every female Muslim and it remains sacrosanct,” he said.  The governor further appealed to various religious heads and leaders to always seek engagement with the state government on any issue to avoid religious crisis.
