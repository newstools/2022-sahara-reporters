The Presidency has accused some governors of attacking President Muhammadu Buhari to gain public support despite their failures at governance. The Senior Special Assistant to President Buhari on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, in a statement on Thursday in Abuja, said such governors blame Buhari for every negative thing happening in their states, thinking that will win them the support of their people.  Adesina said some of the governors known for antagonising Buhari owe workers salaries and have no single kilometre of road constructed by their administration. He noted that rather than provide good governance, such governors want to use antagonising the President as a cheap way to cover up their failures and gain popularity among the people they have failed. The presidential aide said, “Some governors think they can be heroes by antagonising the President. If they owe salaries and pensions, once the month is ending, they begin to abuse the President, thinking their people would forget the outstanding salaries and pensions. When they have not built a single kilometre of road, it is Buhari. “When infrastructure has decayed under them, it is Buhari. When they can’t secure the lives and property of the people they govern, it is Buhari. "They play to the gallery, thinking they will receive applause from their people. No, the only sound the people hear is the rumbling from their bellies, due to hunger. And they know where their problems come from.”
