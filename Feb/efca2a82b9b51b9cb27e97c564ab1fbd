Isabella Ugochi Iloba, the erstwhile Deputy Clerk of the Ninth Senate, has formally assumed duty as the Acting Clerk of the Red Chamber. The development trails the resignation of the outgoing Clerk Ibrahim El-Ladan on age grounds.  Last week, El-Ladan was retired by the National Assembly Service Commission (NASC) over allegations of forgery of documents and age falsification. The former clerk and two other permanent secretaries were accused of forgery and age falsification which earned them sanctions from the NASC. The commission ordered El-Ladan and another officer, Adebayo Anthony Adebanjo, to proceed on retirement with immediate effect, while Michael Okpara should retire in six months. The NASC proceeded to appoint Iloba as acting Clerk to the Senate to take over from El-Ladan. The letter obtained on Tuesday and dated February 9, 2022, is with reference number NASC/PF/69/184. It was titled: “Retirement from service” and addressed to Clerk to Senate, Dauda Ibrahim El-Ladan. Part of the letter reads: “The Commission at its 547th meeting held on Wednesday, 9th February 2022, has approved your retirement from Service with effect from 9th February, 2022. “The Commission wishes to acknowledge your immense contribution to the growth and development of the National Assembly Service. “As you proceed on retirement, please handover your Office and other Government property in your possession to the Deputy Clerk, Senate (Legislative), Ilobah Isabella Ugochi. “On behalf of the Commission, I pray that Almighty God will continue to grant you good health and success in your future endeavours.” The letter was signed on behalf of the Executive Chairman of the NASC, Engr. Ahmed Kadi Amshi. However, there was confusion in the House on Monday when the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan allowed El-Ladan, to perform his official duties unhindered.
