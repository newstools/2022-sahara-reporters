The Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption (PACAC) has said Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has several questions regarding corruption cases to answer to. Sadiq Radda, executive secretary of the committee, said this on Thursday at the 26th Anti-Corruption Situation Room (ACSR) assessment held in Abuja.  A series of secretly recorded videos in 2018 had shown Ganduje pocketing wads of dollars allegedly taken as kickbacks. He, however, denied the allegations. The governor in his denial said the videos were doctored. He blamed it on his perceived opponents, said to be bent on tarnishing his reputation. However, according to Radda, the governor “has many cases to answer while in office and even more after leaving office”. He added that he was surprised by how Ganduje’s son reported his mother to anti-corruption agencies for alleged fraud. “You can see in Kano, Ganduje has many cases to answer while in office, he will answer more out of office and sadly for the first time in Nigeria a son is taking his mother to the EFCC,” Radda said. Human rights lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN), who was at the event, noted that President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration was losing the war against corruption. He said the ministry of justice has been unable to successfully prosecute any anti-corruption case, and that the ministry undermines the steps taken by other entities to ensure justice.
