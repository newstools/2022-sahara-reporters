According to one of the passengers, the train left Kano State on January 31, at exactly 9am but developed a mechanic problem few kilometres to Zaria, Kaduna State.  He accused NRC of abandoning them in the bush for over 32 hours. “Nigerian railway cooperation, we boarded since yesterday 31st January at exactly 9, o clock from Kano heading to Lagos and till now we haven’t reach Zaria, they’ve abandon us inside the bush for almost 18hours, imagine who is afraid of traveling through road because of kidnapping. “Now we are still stuck in the middle of nowhere, we really need your help,” the passenger identified as @YomiCriminal on Twitter posted around 10:25pm on Tuesday.
