Fresh facts have emerged on why the national caretaker committee of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) under the leadership of Yobe State Governor Mai Mala Buni, is delaying the conduct of the party’s national convention. According to Daily Trust, tension and confusion enveloped the ruling party following the indefinite postponement of the convention earlier scheduled for February 26, this year.  Around noon on Monday, the caretaker committee via a letter, dated February 21 to the Chairman Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) fixed the zonal congresses of the party for March 26, this year. The letter jointly signed by Buni and the secretary of the committee, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, was silent about the new date for the convention. However, as the news of the latest development filtered around the top shots of the party, pressure began to be mounted on the committee to rescind its decision. Sources said a section of the presidency, some governors, aspirants for the national chairmanship position and other tendencies faulted the decision taken by the APC leadership, thus around 7pm, the committee backtracked on its earlier decision and fixed the convention for March 26, this year after a marathon meeting. Addressing newsmen at the party’s national secretariat in Abuja, after a closed-door meeting that lasted for several hours, Secretary of the Caretaker Committee, Senator Akpanudoedehe, said the preparation for the national convention would commence on February 24, 2022. He said the zonal congresses would be held before the national convention. “After deliberation and agreement with the committee, we have agreed and approved that the activities of the national convention commence from February 24 and terminate on March 26. The convention activities commence on February 24 and it will terminate at the Eagle Square on March 24,” he said.
