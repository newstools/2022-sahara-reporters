A Nigerian Air Force fighter jet on a mission against bandits in Kaduna State has mistakenly bombed a ground soldier, PRNigeria reports. This comes as the fighter jets also killed scores of fleeing armed bandits in the area.  It was learnt that the unnamed ground soldier lost his life after sustaining 'terrible' injuries from the military bombardments he was caught in. The terrorists, who were fleeing troops’ onslaughts in Niger, were intercepted at Labi, along Kaduna - Birnin Gwari Road, a security intelligence officer said. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the bandits were reported to be in contact with ground troops around the LABI general area. "Subsequently, the contact with the troops led to the bandits taking the option of following another route to continue their movement. "Effective intelligence efforts necessitated the blocking of their alternative route by the reinforcing ground forces and the dispatch of attack platforms bearing heavy armament for effective annihilation of the armed bandits. "On arrival, visual and radio contact were established with the ground forces who described the direction of the bandits to the Crew. "The armed bandits and herds of cattle were brought to instant doom as airstrikes were conducted in close succession over the general area. Fleeing bandits were followed up and engaged decisively and with sincerity of purpose," he said. See Also
