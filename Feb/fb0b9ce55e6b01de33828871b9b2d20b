The guidelines regarding the qualifications of candidates vying for the office of the Rector of Adamawa State Polytechnic have been changed arbitrarily in an alleged plot to block a popular candidate, SaharaReporters has learnt.Some members of the management who spoke to SaharaReporters on condition of anonymity blamed the Governing Council of the institution, saying, "the whole shenanigans has to do with plans to stop the deputy rector, Timothy Siya.” 





Others think nepotism and religious consideration were remotely responsible for the bizarre distortion of the criteria just as some alleged that the chairman of the Governing Council, David Shall, might have orchestrated things to favour himself.The documents detailing the guidelines indicate that among other qualifications, a candidate wishing to become the Rector must possess five years post “Chief Lecturer” appointment in the Polytheistic system, among other qualifications. The document seen by SaharaReporters reads in parts, "He/she shall have a sound educational background with 20 years cognate experience in any fields of science and technology, out of which 5 years must have been spent in the Polytechnic system."He/she shall not be below the rank of Chief Lecturer or other positions obtainable in other tertiary institutions with at least 3 years of satisfactory service on the grade."He/she may possess PhD/M Sc degree in relevant fields plus 15/18 years cognate experience respectively, out of which at least 5 years must have been spent in the Polytechnic system.” Regardless of other qualities, the guideline clearly emphasises "five years post Chief Lecturer service in the polytechnic system>” However, in a flagrant disregard to the guideline, advertisement for the post of the Rector as published in some national dailies, omitted the critical requirement of five years post “Chief Lecturer” service in the Polytechnic system.As alleged, the chairman, Governing Council of the Polytechnic, David Shall, who obviously lacks cognate experience in the Polytechnic system, has in a thriving rumour been linked to frantic moves to vie for the Rector's job.When contacted, Shall refused to comment saying his decline to respond was "for failing to introduce yourself when you called yesterday, I'll not answer your question.” Recall that Shall was recently arrested by operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).
