The United States Department of Justice says only the Nigerian government can provide reasons for the delay in the extradition of suspended DCP Abba Kyari, to the U.S. The “super cop” had yet to be extradited despite a United States Federal Bureau of Investigation which revealed how Kyari allegedly collaborated with a fraudster, Ramon Abbas, Hushpuppi, in a multi-million dollar scam.  The FBI also alleged that the embattled social media celebrity sent money to Kyari via a third person’s bank account and hosted him in his Dubai apartment. Amid the allegations, the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), on Monday, declared Kyari wanted for drug trafficking. People’s Gazette had sent a mail to the US Department of Justice over Kyari's extradition, Nicole Oxman, a spokeswoman for the DOJ, responded, “As a matter of policy, the department generally does not comment on extradition-related matters. We defer any questions about the status of a defendant’s extradition to the foreign country.” A week ago, the Justice minister Abubakar Malami had disclosed on Channels TV that the Nigerian government was collaborating with the U.S. government on the case of Kyari’s involvement with Hushpupi. “There is a lot of issues that are ongoing, inclusive of the possibility and consideration for extradition and associated things.” He, however, did not provide a time frame for the process to be completed. Since the FBI uncovered Kyari’s involvement in the multimillion-dollar internet scam by Hushpuppi and his syndicate, three separate panels had been set up by the police to examine and reexamine the case filed by the FBI against him.
