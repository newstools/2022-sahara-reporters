Femi Falana (SAN), the lawyer representing the family of the slain master’s student of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Timothy Adegoke, has demanded that the trial of all suspects arrested in connection with the student’s death at Hilton Hotel, Ile-Ife, be held in Osun State. Adegoke had lodged in Hilton Hotels and Resorts at Ile-Ife upon his arrival from Abuja on November 5 to enable him to arrive early for his examination at the OAU Distance Learning Centre, Moro, Osun State, on November 6 and November 7.  He later went missing and was found dead buried in a grave following police investigation of the hotel owner, Dr Rahman Adedoyin and its workers. After Adegoke was declared missing, the police were invited and seven suspects were arrested after which investigation commenced. Later, the Intelligence Response Team, Abuja, took over the investigation and the case was transferred to the Federal Capital Territory. Upon the conclusion of investigation, the police charged the accused persons to a high court in Abuja. The police are charging the owner of the hotel with illegally disposing of Adegoke’s body, altering and cancelling his payment receipt, and removal of the hotel’s CCTV cameras with intent to destroy evidence. Others charged alongside Adedoyin are Adedeji Adesola, 23; Magdalene Chiefuna, 24; Adeniyi Aderogba, 37; Oluwale Lawrence, 37, Oyetunde Kazeem, 38; Adebayo Kunle, 35, and some who have taken to their heels. But Falana in a letter written on behalf of the family to the Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba opposed the location where the police have decided to try Adedoyin and others.

The lawyer said the demand was made since none of the elements of the offence to be tried by the FCT High Court took place in the Abuja. The letter read, “We are Solicitors to the aged parents of the Late Timothy Adegoke (hereinafter referred to as "our clients") on whose behalf we write this letter. Our clients' instructions are briefly summarised and stated as follows: “The son of our clients, Timothy Adegoke, was a 37-year-old Master of Business Administration student at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife, Osun State. Timothy had lodged at the Hilton Honours Hotel, Ile Ife on November 6, 2021 while preparing for his examinations in the University. He was abducted in his room later in the night and taken to the bush where he was brutally killed by a group of suspected assassins. “Having killed Timothy in a gruesome manner the assassins mutilated his body and proceed to bury it in an unmarked grave. The police investigation has since exhumed the mutilated body of the deceased. Based on the complaint of our clients the Nigeria Police Force arrested some of the suspects while others who are currently at large had been declared wanted. “To our utter dismay the arrested suspects have been arraigned before the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory on a 7- count charge of conspiracy to commit murder, murder, conspiracy to commit improper or indecent interference with the body of the deceased, uttering and intent to destroy evidence under the Penal Code.
