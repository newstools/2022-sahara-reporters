The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, has said that the statement that he vowed to fight dirty if there were plans to halt his presidential ambition in 2023, was taken out of its right context.Tinubu accused media houses of twisting his words when he visited the Olubadan-designate, Senator Lekan Balogun on Sunday. This was made known in a statement by his media aide, Mr Tunde Rahman, on Monday in Lagos State.“This caption and report are inaccurate and erroneous. Sadly, the wrong headline and story have been latched on by some online platforms/blogs and commentators to pour invective on my person.“These commentaries and remarks are unfortunate because they are groundless, misinformed and misdirected. Hence, this clarification has become imperative,” he said.Tinubu stressed that at no time during the visit and in his speech did he indicate that he would fight dirty for his presidential ambition.He noted that his words were carefully chosen stating that the people did not lend credence to such interpretation.However, Tinubu, while addressing the Olubadan designate, said: “Kabiyesi, all I have come for is to beg you to continue to pray for me, the entire Yoruba race and the country.“I am out to become the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and there is a wise saying that if you want to wrestle with the pig, be ready to get dirty and deal with the poo-poo.“I am ready to get dirty. No intimidation, no blackmail, no sort of insult will get me angry to the extent that I will say no more, I don’t want again.”
