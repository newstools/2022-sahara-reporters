 The accident occurred around 8 am opposite Ilorin International Airport along the Ilorin-Ogbomoso highway. Twenty persons were said to be onboard the ill-fated Toyota Corolla car and Toyota Hiace commercial bus before the incident. The vehicles registration numbers are LRN787FE Toyota Corolla and AFN06YL Toyota Hiace. One of the vehicles involved in the crash was said to have carried petrol-filled kegs. State sector commander of the FRSC, Jonathan Owoade, confirmed the development and described the crash as unfortunate. He said, “A car coming out of the airport ran across the road, thinking it could have crossed the road before the bus got to it. Incidentally, it was said that it was carrying fuel.” Owoade added that passers-by helped to ferry the injured persons to the state General Hospital, Ilorin. He said that the FRSC patrol team had deposited the corpses of the dead at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital (UITH) mortuary.
