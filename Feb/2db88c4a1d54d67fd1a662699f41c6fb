The Nigeria Police Force, Ogun State command, has attributed the increase in ritual killings among young people to the promotion of such in Nollywood movies. The command's spokesperson, Abimbola Oyeyemi, also urged religious bodies to desist from preaching only about prosperity advising them to hinge their sermons on morality. Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi He made the call while parading the 18-year-old man, Soliu Majekodunmi, who beheaded his girlfriend for money rituals in the state. While speaking to newsmen, Oyeyemi said these suspects learnt the evil acts from some of the movies they watched. “This can only be described as a superlative degree of callousness. It is despicable and barbaric at this time for somebody to still have it in mind that money can be made if he sacrifices the life of a fellow human being. “More so, what is it that teenagers want to use the money for that will lead them to this type of heinous crime? It is still beyond the comprehension of a normal human being “I want to say that many parents have failed in their responsibilities. This is a result of bad parenting. It is a result of complete failure of parental responsibility because if this thing has not been encouraged by the parents, I do not believe that any properly brought up child will want to embark on this type of criminality. “I also want to advise that the generality of people have a lot of work to do, the religious bodies, entertainment bodies and everybody that has one thing or the other on protecting life and properties. “The religious bodies should stop preaching only prosperity, you should be preaching morality more than the way you preach prosperity. Nollywood actors and the movie censors board have a lot to do to regulate the type of films they produce because some of them (ritual suspects) learn it in movies,” he said.
