The Acting Controller General, Federal Fire Service (FFS), Dr Karebo Samson, has cautioned Nigerians against the storage of Premium Motor Spirits (PMS) popularly known as petrol in their homes during the present biting period of scarcity. The CG warned that petrol as highly inflammable could lead to infernos in homes when stored in residences due to the scarcity.  “Nigerians must resist the temptation of storing PMS in their homes or other confined places due to the current challenge of scarcity, as doing that will endanger their lives and that of others. “As we all know, children like to experiment, so storing PMS at home could be putting them at high risk especially if it is within their reach," Samson said. According to a release on Wednesday by Abraham Paul, the service’s Public Relations Officer, the CG explained that there was always a risk of a fire outbreak or an explosion if there was a source of ignition nearby such as a naked flame or an electrical spark. The CG stressed that Nigerians should avoid any act which could lead to fire outbreak in their environment.
