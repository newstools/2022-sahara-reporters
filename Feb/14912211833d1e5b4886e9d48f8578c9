Dozens of villagers have fled their homes amid fear of invasion by armed herders in Benue State. It was learnt that armed herdsmen with thousands of cows flooded four villages of Negev, Yonov, Turan and Tombo; forcing villagers to scamper to safer areas.  Residents have cried out to authorities to intervene and help secure their communities so they could return home. The latest invasion comes amid renewed threat to enforce anti-open grazing law by the state government under Governor Samuel Ortom. A community leader in the area, Joseph Anawah, who raised the alarm on Tuesday, said several villages had been taken over by the armed herders with thousands of their cattle. Anawah said, "The invasion by the armed herders had also become a serious threat to the neighbouring communities in Buruku and Guma local government areas. "The invaders crossed River Benue to settle at Tse Azaye, Tse Agah, Tse Getim and Tse Iosun all in Tombo council ward," he said. When contacted, the Secretary of Miyeitti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) in the state, Ibrahim Galma, said he was out of the state but would get in touch with other members of the association in the affected area before commenting on the matter. When contacted, spokesperson for the police in the State, SP Catherine Anene, promised to call back but had yet to do so as of the time of filing this report.
