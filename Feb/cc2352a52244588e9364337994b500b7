The Nigerian Drug Law Enforcement Agency has stated that it arrested a major drug kingpin operating the notorious Patey Lagos Island drug haven, Mrs Sherifat Kehinde Lawal. The NDLEA said the woman was arrested along with six other suspects by operatives, who also recovered 5,862 kilograms of assorted illicit drugs including Loud and Codeine in a raid on Saturday.  SaharaReporters earlier reported that youths in the area tried to prevent the raid with some hoodlums clashing with NDLEA operatives resulting in gunshots. Following credible intelligence and follow up surveillance on illicit drug dealings in Osho, Gambari and Beecroft Streets in the Patey Area of Lagos Island, anti-narcotic officers stormed the Gambari Street base of the drug kingpin where they arrested her and six of her accomplices at 9:30am on Saturday. A statement by NDLEA spokesperson, Femi Babafemi, said other members of the cartel operating in the axis mobilised hoodlums, who attacked the operatives with stones, bottles and guns in a bid to prevent th from arresting other kingpins marked for arrest as well as taking the suspects already nabbed and drug exhibits away. The statement reads, “The operatives were able to tactically defend themselves, took the suspects and exhibits away. Other suspects in custody with Mrs Lawal include Ahmed Yisau; Solomon Alape; Olayemi Akinola; Salami Qudus; Bakare Rafiu; Rose Samson; Yusuf Rofiat, and Chukwudi Egon. “In his reaction to the development, Chairman/Chief Executive of NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Mohamed Buba Marwa (Retd), commended the officers and men of the Lagos Command of the agency for the successful operation. "He warned those being used by drug cartels to obstruct or attack anti-narcotic officers in the course of doing their work to desist or face dire consequences.”
