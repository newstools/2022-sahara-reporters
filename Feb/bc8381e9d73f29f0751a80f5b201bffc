A former Minister of Aviation in Nigeria, Femi Fani-Kayode, has secured a court order to prevent his ex-wife, Precious Chikwendu, from speaking at a public event, Green Shift (Apostolic Roundtable) scheduled for February 24, 2022.Fani-Kayode had approached the Family Court of the Federal Capital Territory on February 17, 2022, to seek its consent to compel Chikwendu from attending or speaking at the event and any of its kind. The former husband and wife have in recent times attacked each other publicly, especially after Fani-Kayode denied Chikwendu access to their four children since their separation in August 2020.In December 2021, the former beauty queen in a video shared on Instagram alleged that she experienced domestic violence while with the former minister. She also said she suffered sexual deprivation in the marriage for six years as a result of Fani-Kayode's alleged erectile dysfunction.She disclosed that she had been silent since she left the politician but was forced to speak in order not to pass the wrong message to the public.She added that while she knew that children should not be kept away from their father, she insisted that they shouldn't also be kept away from her because he couldn't look after them well.In granting the former minister's prayers in the latest lawsuit, the Presiding Chief Magistrate of the Family Court of the Federal Capital Territory, Njideka Duru, in an order of interim injunction restrained Chikwendu or her representatives from commenting on or discussing during the scheduled event issues revolving around her marriage to Fani-Kayode and their children.The court also barred her from making any presentation at public gatherings or social media platforms of the broken relationship or family issue that has already been substituted to the court for determination between the applicant and herself.The court order further barred Chikwendu from, "Publishing the name, and address of school, photograph or making any comment, presenting any speech or paper whether at a public gathering or during a programme described as Green Shift (Apostolic Roundtable) slated for February 24, 2022, or any social media platform likely to lead to the identification of any of the children whose custody issues have been submitted to this court for determination."The court thereafter adjourned the matter for further hearing until March 24, 2022.
