The Concerned Nigerians group has condemned a lawsuit threat against its convener, Deji Adeyanju, by newly confirmed National Commissioner (South-South) of the Independent National Electoral Commission, Rhoda Gumus. Gumus, a nominee from Bayelsa State, is said to be a member of the All Progressives Congress and the Nigerian Senate had confirmed her despite her reported party affiliation.  Adeyanju had earlier kicked against the move, arguing that such was inimical to the country's democracy and electoral process. But Gumus had threatened to sue the human rights activist if he failed to retract his claim. Reacting to the threat in a statement on Saturday, Concerned Nigerians said the group remained unperturbed over the issue.

The group maintained its earlier position that Gumus was a member of the APC during her appointment as INEC commissioner. The statement reads, "Our attention has been drawn to a letter published by the law firm of Adams Fasingha & Co on behalf of Prof Rhoda Gumus wherein she denied membership of the All Progressives Congress and threatened to sue our convener, Comrade Deji Adeyanju, if the allegation was not retracted.  "We wish to state that we stand on our previous publication on Prof Gumus’ membership of the APC. It is embarrassing to note that despite the avalanche of petitions against her nomination on the ground that she is a member of the APC; Prof Gumus lacked the integrity to publicly deny her membership of the APC prior to her confirmation by the Nigerian Senate. This belated denial was only issued after her confirmation to save face and portray some level of integrity that she clearly lacks.

"We must ask Prof Gumus, where was she when several members of the APC and other APC support groups took out publications in national dailies congratulating her on her nomination as an Independent National Electoral Commission federal commissioner? Did she debunk any of these publications? No.  "Prof Gumus is aware that her nomination as INEC federal electoral commissioner was solely on the strength of her membership of the APC. Accordingly, it would have been foolhardy for her to deny her membership of the APC before the senate confirmation, hence, this belated denial.  "We are unfazed by Prof Gumus’ threat of litigation on account of some illusionary forged APC membership card. In fact, we have taken steps to initiate a civil suit seeking to stop Prof Gumus’ swearing in as an INEC federal commissioner. “We must remind Prof Gumus that allegations of forgery are criminal in nature and she has the enormous duty to prove same despite the litany of evidence confirming her membership of APC. We are ready to meet her in court.  "Lastly, we must state that our quest for good governance and rule of law is not influenced by personal relationship as we have nothing against Prof Gumus. However, we will not stand by while our electoral process is being destroyed by self serving politicians."
