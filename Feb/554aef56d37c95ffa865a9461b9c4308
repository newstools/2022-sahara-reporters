President Muhammadu Buhari has appointed Mohammed Bello Koko as the substantive Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA).The Federal Ministry of Transportation disclosed this in a circular on Tuesday, which was signed by its Director, Press and Public Relations, Eric Ojiekwe. “Prior to this appointment, Koko was the executive director, finance & administration of NPA,” the statement reads.Meanwhile, the Pandora Papers in 2021 revealed that Bello Koko was behind two shell companies incorporated in a tax haven to anonymously invest in the United Kingdom property market. This potentially violates Nigeria’s public service code of conduct laws.Pandora Papers also disclosed that he and his wife, Agatha Anne Koko, enlisted the services of financial secrecy seller, Cook Worldwide and Alemán, Cordero, Galindo & Lee (Alcogal), an offshore law firm, to register Coulwood Limited (reg. number: 1487897) and Marney Limited (reg. number: 1487944) in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), one of the world’s most commonly used tax havens, in 2008. Both companies were registered the same day, June 19, 2008.Though a public servant, Bello Koko is also a director of the two companies, in violation of Nigeria’s Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act (Sections 5 and 6).Pandora Papers project is led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).
