The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has warned that the period of cabals forcing leaders on the people is over. This is even as the body stated that it is mobilising the electorate ahead of the 2023 general elections to stop cabals from dictating who will run the country, the News Agency of Nigeria reports.  The CAN’s chairman in Lagos State, Stephen Adegbite, disclosed this in an interview on the sideline of the media parley to announce the 2022 Inter-Denominational Divine Service (IDDS). “The period of cabals forcing rulers on the people has passed. As a people, we need to seize the opportunity of periodic transition offered by the democratic system of governance to improve on our individual and national lives by electing competent leaders of our choice.” According to him, voter education and mobilisation were essential to deepen democratic culture in the polity, pointing out that it would foster peace, harmony and economic growth of the nation. Adegbeti, who decried the rate of economic hardship in the country, its attendant insecurity and despondency, said the era of imposition of incompetent rulers on the people was over. “Our local government area officials are in the field to conscientise people on the need to update their voter cards in order to participate in the elections that would give the country better leaders come 2023. At the moment, the project is mobilisation for voter registration,” he stated. Adegbeti condemned the surge in get-rich-quick ritual killings and urged Nigerian youths to be hard-working and refrain from crimes. The inter-denominational divine service will hold at the Apostolic Church, Lagos Headquarters, on February 19. The Catholic Archbishop of Lagos, Alfred Adewale-Martins, will anchor the service.
