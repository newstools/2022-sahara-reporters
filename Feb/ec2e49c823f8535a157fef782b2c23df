A first-year female student of the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile-Ife, Osun state, has died after accidentally falling inside a soakaway in one of the school's hostels.  This was made known in a statement issued by the students’ union president of the school, Ogunperi Taofeek Olalekan.  According to the statement, the deceased, Heritage Ajibola, was a student of the Department of Linguistics and African Languages.  The unfortunate incident was said to have occurred at Bver Hostel, Maintenance Hostels on Wednesday afternoon.  Olalekan, in the statement, blamed the incident on lack of proper maintenance of the septic tank that the student fell into.  “This incident is highly unfortunate. The Union mourns her. May her soul rest in peace. May God give her family, friends and coursemates the fortitude to bear this irreparable loss.  “It must be noted that Heritage's death was avoidable if the soakaway system was properly constructed and covered. It is saddening that this has happened despite the huge amounts of money paid by students for rent.  “The Management of the Hostel must answer for the death of Heritage. The Union is immediately demanding justice for Heritage, with a view to forestalling a possible reoccurrence of this.”Attachments area
