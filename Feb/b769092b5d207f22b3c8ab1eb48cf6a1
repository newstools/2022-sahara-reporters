A former Senator representing Kaduna Central, Shehu Sani has said some communities in Niger and Kaduna states have been defending their territories against terrorists. According to the former senator, the communities have been achieving success by targeting and killing those identified as informants for the terrorists. Shehu Sani Sani, who took to his Twitter handle on Tuesday, also took a swipe at the Nigerian army, which had claimed that the leader of a notorious gang of bandits, Bello Turji, was on the run following military onslaughts. The former lawmaker said there are reports that the bandit kingpin, Turji, who was reportedly begging for peace, have been massacring people in the North. He wrote, “Some villages in Niger and Kaduna states have organised themselves to defend their ancestral lands against terrorists, and they are achieving success with the help of the military; I asked one of them the secret, and he replied ‘identifying and crushing the terrorists’ informants.’”  “They said North West terror leader, Turji was bombarded, Cornered and was even begging for peace…and then boom only to hear he is still massacring,” he said in an earlier post on Tuesday.
