The leadership of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) alongside the Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees and Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria, on Monday, led a protest to the National Assembly. The protesters are calling for overwhelming votes from the federal lawmakers, ahead of the clause by clause voting in the ongoing constitutional amendments.  They have also demanded that lawmakers vote in favour of autonomy for local governments and the judiciary. According to them, the lack of autonomy for the judicial arm of government, as well as local governments as the third tier of government, runs contrary to democratic principles. Meanwhile, the protest which held Monday in the Federal Capital Territory will continue on Tuesday. One of their leaders stated, “Tomorrow, we'll get up to the level of the parliament where we'll rub minds, heads and shoulders with those we've sent there but today, we'll make do with having a conversation at the entrance. “We'll continue to push until we get what we're looking for."
