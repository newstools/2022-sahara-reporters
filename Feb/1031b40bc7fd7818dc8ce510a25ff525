A United States Professor and columnist, Farooq Kperogi says the erstwhile loyalists of the national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu have lost respect for him.Kperogi was reacting to the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola's mockery of Tinubu. One of President Muhammadu Buhari's ministers, Aregbesola had on Monday while addressing APC members in Ijebu-jesa, described his successor, Gboyega Oyetola as the most “useless and corrupt governor to ever rule the state.” The minister also attacked Tinubu, saying the same treatment meted out to a former Lagos State governor, Akinwunmi Ambode, which foreclosed his re-election bid in 2019, would be visited on Oyetola.Although in the video, Aregbesola did not mention the APC presidential aspirant’s name, he made insinuations that the former Lagos governor was responsible for the political situation in Osun, including how he has abused his leadership and suddenly assumed the god complex.Aregbesola while castigating Tinubu also said, “Won ti n to ara”, meaning “they’re already peeing themselves".This comes a few days after the APC leader was seen in a viral video with suspected pee stains on his attire during a visit to the Awujale of Ijebuland.Kperogi in a Twitter post described the inner caucus of the former Lagos governor as “traitors".“It appears like Tinubu's previously impregnable political base has now totally collapsed. He has lost his mystique & is now openly challenged and even mocked by previous loyalists such as Rauf Aregbesola.“His inner circle is peopled by 'traitors' who habitually leak unflattering info to the public about his health struggles.“And his PR team is a crying disaster of ineptitude. Well, every beginning has an end. I think this is the end for Tinubu, but it's an embarrassing end.”
