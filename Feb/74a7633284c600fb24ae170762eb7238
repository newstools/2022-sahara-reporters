UEFA has moved this season’s Champions League final from Saint Petersburg in Russia to Paris in France following the invasion of Ukraine by Vladimir Putin’s government. UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin chaired an extraordinary meeting of the Executive Committee on Friday where it was decided that the Champions League final should be moved away from Saint Petersburg.  The final will now hold at the Stade de France in Paris, as first reported by the New York Times. Paris last hosted the European Cup final in 2006, when Barcelona defeated Arsenal 2-1. UEFA said in a statement: "The UEFA executive committee decided to relocate the final of the 2021-22 UEFA Men's Champions League from St Petersburg to Stade de France in St Denis.  "The game will be played as initially scheduled on Saturday, May 28 at 2100 CET.  "UEFA wishes to express its thanks and appreciation to French Republic president Emmanuel Macron for his personal support and commitment to have European club football's most prestigious game moved to France at a time of unparalleled crisis."  UEFA also said it would relocate any games in tournaments it controls that were to be played in Russia and Ukraine, whether involving clubs or national teams, until further notice.
