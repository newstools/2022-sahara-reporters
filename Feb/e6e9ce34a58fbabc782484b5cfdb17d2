Chukwudimeme Onwuamadike, aka Evans, and two others, have been declared guilty of kidnapping and sentenced to life imprisonment by a Lagos High Court, sitting in Ikeja. Justice Hakeem Oshodi of the Lagos High Court in Ikeja on Friday sentenced the man popularly known as billionaire kidnapper or Evans, and his accomplices – Uche Amadi and Okwuchukwu Nwachukwu to life imprisonment.  The Ikeja High Court premises in Lagos were under tight security as the judge gave the verdict. The court found them guilty of conspiracy and kidnapping of Mr Donatius Dunu, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Maydon Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Donatus Dunu was kidnapped on February 14, 2017, and a ransom of €223,000 was collected from his family. The judge, however, discharged and acquitted the other co-defendants: Ogechi Uchechukwu, Chilaka Ifeanyi, formerly a soldier; and Victor Aduba, also an ex-soldier. The court said there was no evidence linking them to the crimes.
