A Federal High Court in Abuja has again adjourned the fundamental rights enforcement suit filed by Emeka Richmond Ngornadi, a businessman who was detained at the underground cell of the Department of State Services (DSS) for allegedly supporting the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) on social media.  Ngornadi was arrested and detained for allegedly making comments on social media in support of IPOB, in its case against the Director-General of the secret police, Yusuf Bichi.  Ngornadi had in the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/994 C filed by his lawyer, Barrister Festus Ogun asked the court to order the DSS to pay him N10 million as general and aggravated damages for his detention and illegal violation of fundamental rights.  The trial judge, Justice Maha at the resumed hearing of the case on Tuesday informed both counsel that she had adopted too many processes already and therefore could not proceed with the hearing of the application.  She added that if she proceeded to hear the application, she would be unable to deliver judgement within three months as stipulated by law.  The matter was subsequently adjourned to May 10, 2022.  SaharaReporters had on August 9, 2021, reported how Ngornadi was abducted by the DSS while travelling from Lagos to Anambra to deliver to his pregnant wife baby items and goods he had bought for her.  She had earlier called to inform him that her Estimated Delivery Date (EED) was close.  He later developed in detention a strange illness with rashes all over his body. He was said to have earlier had typhoid fever and malaria.  He was allegedly tortured by DSS operatives in an attempt to force him to admit to being an IPOB member which affected one of his ears.  He was said to have been denied access to doctors and drugs by the secret police, which made his condition deteriorate in the cell.
