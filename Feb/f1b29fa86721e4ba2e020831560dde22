Femi Babafemi, spokesperson of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) says identity cards carried by the agency’s officers also doubled as search and arrest warrants.Babafemi said this on Friday during a Twitter Spaces conversation hosted by the NDLEA. This is coming days after the agency came under severe criticisms over the manner in which its officers conduct searches and arrest of drug suspects.Some Nigerians had accused NDLEA operatives of invading houses of suspects without search or arrest warrant.However, Babafemi claimed that what operatives need to make arrest or search are their identity cards.He also appealed to Nigerians to stop the act of resisting arrest and to also desist from attacking NDLEA operatives while on official duties.
