Unknown gunmen have killed Sule Mathew, a first-class graduate of Communication and former intern with PRNigeria while travelling to Anambra State with other passengers.  The bereaved family confirmed the tragic incident involving the 21-year-old at the weekend.  Mathew, who studied Information and Media Studies, graduated with a first-class from the Faculty of Communication, Bayero University Kano recently.  He and others were murdered at Ekwulobia in Aguata Local Government Area. Their remains were deposited at the General Hospital in the town.  Jemila, the sister, disclosed that Mathew, his boss and the rest embarked on the trip in a private vehicle.  She said the assailants ambushed them and opened fire. Only the driver, who hurried out on sighting them, was able to run into the bush.  “When we couldn’t reach Sule and heard of the incident, we sent his picture to the mortuary. We got feedback that he was identified among those killed,” she said.  A course mate of Mr Mathew who also interned with him at PRNigeria, Salis Manager, said Mathew was billed to participate in the forthcoming orientation programme of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC).
