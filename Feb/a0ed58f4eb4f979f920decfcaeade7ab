A former governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha has declared his interest to run for the 2023 presidency. Okorocha, during his speech, was seen quoting the Quran passionately as he claimed he is a candidate for justice, according to Allah's command in Surah An-Nahl 16:90. The senator representing Imo West senatorial district urged his listeners to vote for him as he promised them a New Nigeria.He said in the video from 30:20 to 34:14, “It is for this reason that I want to inform you that permit me to be your pilot for the New Nigeria, that I might pilot this aircraft of the New Nigeria to its destiny and safe arrival to the destination.“I understand as I take off with this plane as your pilot, there might be few turbulence, don't worry, Captain Rochas is in command but it will get to a point, after the rough bad weather that we shall get to the cruising point when I shall say to Alhaja Udi, Professor, Adamu, Segun, Okey, I'll say come onboard, come untie your seatbelt and let us enjoy the New Nigeria.“Let me prophesy and tell you there shall be a new political order, all I want is to appeal to our politicians and those who want confusion to please think about the unity of the country. “Today, you may have heard that people are talking about zoning, rotation, I'm not a candidate of either but a candidate of justice. Maybe the south has not been able to present its matter very well before the rest of Nigeria...“I'm sure if you say to a Muslim, a Northerner and say to him, remember my friends from the North and my brothers from the Muslim Ummah that remember that the principal cardinal point upon which Islam is built is justice, Prophet Mohammed (S.A.W) acknowledged the fact that in Quran chapter 16 verse 90, it says, 'اِنَّ اللّٰهَ يَاۡمُرُ بِالۡعَدۡلِ وَالۡاِحۡسَانِ وَاِيۡتَآىـئِ ذِى الۡقُرۡبٰى وَيَنۡهٰى عَنِ الۡفَحۡشَآءِ وَالۡمُنۡكَرِ وَالۡبَغۡىِ​ۚ يَعِظُكُمۡ لَعَلَّكُمۡ تَذَكَّرُوۡنَ' stating verily, God commands justice and fairness.”https://youtu.be/w_KhpJJH0ns
