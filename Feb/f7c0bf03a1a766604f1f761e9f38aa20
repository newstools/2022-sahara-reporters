President Muhammadu Buhari says he is looking forward to being regarded as a former President of Nigeria as he envisages the end of his tenure.This is even as the President noted for the umpteenth time that he would not go beyond the two tenure constitutionally required, unlike traditional rulers who he observed their appointments were terminal. Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari.



Buhari stated this on Thursday while speaking at a courtesy visit to the palace of Emir of Lafia, Nasarawa State, Retired Justice Sidi Bage Muhammad 1.He also urged the leaders who take the oath of office, swearing with the Holy Book, to be careful not to abuse the trust of leadership placed on them by the people and God.A statement issued by Femi Adesina, Special Adviser to the President (Media & Publicity) quoted him as saying, “The traditional ruler is on a terminal appointment. Constitutionally, we (elected public office holders) are not. I cannot go beyond two terms and I have sworn by the Holy Quran that I will uphold the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.“Politics apart, whenever we are made to swear by the Holy Quran, we have to be very careful. We must make sure that we do not abuse the trust God has given us as leaders.“I have seen former governors here and I am looking forward to also becoming a former President.”He further expressed delight at the situation in Nasarawa as he noted that the North-Central State was wearing a new look since his last visit in 2019.He congratulated the immediate past governor and senator representing Nasarawa South Senatorial District, Umaru Tanko Al-Makura and the incumbent, Governor Abdullahi Sule, for the laudable initiatives and accomplishments in the state.According to the statement, while welcoming the president to the over 200-year old palace, the Emir of Lafia thanked him for ending the problem of insufficient power to Nasarawa State with the provision of a 330kVA sub-station.
