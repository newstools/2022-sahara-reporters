The Gambia’s Drug Law Enforcement Agency has arrested 36-year-old Nigerian national, Elem Onyekachi Chidozie in Kunkujang. Chidozie was arrested with one parcel of suspected cannabis sativa, ten pieces of suspected cannabis resin (hashish), and eight tablets of suspected clonazepam, Nigeria Abroad reports.  He has been detained and said to be helping officers of the drug law enforcement agency in their investigation. DLEAG had earlier expressed concern over the increased usage of drugs among youths in the Gambia. In a related development, a 32-year-old Senegalese with eleven wraps of suspected heroin and four stones of suspected cocaine was also arrested. “It is disappointing and disheartening that people, especially relatives, will be aware of their kinsmen's involvement in illicit activities and wouldn’t make any effort to address it. “On the contrary, they will do everything humanly possible to ensure that such people are shielded and not brought to book. We must understand that it is our collective responsibility to ensure that our societies are safe and secure,” DLEAG said. “We are losing youths with high potential and prospects to drugs. Children as young as 12 sit at joints within our communities abusing drugs all day long. No one dares to address them for fear of the disrespect they will receive from them. The agency continues to receive a countless number of complaints and reports from the public regarding drug-related activities and open drug abuse,” it added.
