Vice President Yemi Osinbajo (SAN) has departed Abuja for Accra, Ghana to represent Nigeria at an Extraordinary Summit of the ECOWAS Authority of Heads of State and Government deliberating today on the political situation in Burkina Faso, Mali and Guinea. This was disclosed in a statement by Laolu Akande, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media & Publicity (Office of the Vice President). Vice President Yemi Osinbajo “The meeting which is coming as part of the resolutions reached at last week’s virtual meeting chaired by Ghana’s President Nana Akufo-Addo, will review the report of the ECOWAS delegation despatched to Quagadougou to meet with the military junta who recently seized power in Burkina Faso. “The summit will be attended by regional leaders who will be considering imposing additional sanctions after the country was suspended from the regional body last week. “Last Monday, soldiers forced the removal of democratically elected President Roch March Kabore from office in a military coup. The military takeover of government in Burkina Faso follows the same occurrence in Mali and Guinea recently. “It would be recalled that the President has been delegating the Vice President to represent Nigeria at a series of ECOWAS leaders' summits on the issues of undemocratic, military takeover of governments in the region.” The Vice President will be accompanied by the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Zubairu Dada, Presidential Special Adviser on Economic Matters, Dr. Adeyemi Dipeolu, himself also an Ambassador, and other top Nigerian diplomats. He is expected back in Abuja later today. This comes hours after the presidency announced the participation of President Muhammadu Buhari at the 35th Ordinary Session of Assembly of the African Union Heads of State and Government taking place in Ethiopia.
