One person was reportedly killed at Orozo Primary School polling unit during the area council elections in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, on Saturday. It was gathered that the Independent National Electoral Commission had sent a signal directing those, who could not verify their fingerprints by Bimodal Voter Accreditation System to be allowed to vote even after 2:30pm when voting had ended.  SaharaReporters gathered that about seven sponsored thugs brandishing dangerous weapons from Karshi, a nearby town, allegedly stormed the primary school and snatched the ballot boxes. An eyewitness, who spoke with SaharaReporters, said some youth from Orozo in the process identified the attackers and hurriedly chased them with the view to retrieving the ballot boxes from them . He said the youth were able to catch up with them and killed one of the hoodlums while two were arrested. He said, "The attackers arrived Orozo Primary School after the voting had ended and snatched ballot boxes. They attacked the INEC officials and carted away their materials. "But the Orozo boys chased them because they knew that they were from Karshi. "They hit one of them with plank on his head and he died immediately. They were able to arrest two others but the remaining ones escaped." Meanwhile, it took the timely intervention of the police and army, who shot sporadically into the air, to disperse the angry youth from the area. The angry mob in the process also set ablaze a hilux vehicle allegedly belonging to INEC. SaharaReporters also gathered that three people were killed in Karshi in a reprisal attack but this could not be verified as at the time of this report.
