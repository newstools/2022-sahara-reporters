A former Minister of Youth and Sports, Solomon Dalung, says the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has not performed to the expectations of Nigerians, adding that many are disappointed with the party. Speaking to BBC Hausa at the official launch of a movement in Abuja, The New Movement (TNM), the former Minister said the party had failed woefully. He said the party also failed to fulfil the promises it made to Nigerians.  Dalung served as a minister in the first tenure of President Muhammadu Buhari. “The truth must be told that the APC as a party did not fulfil the promises it made to Nigerians,” he said. “It didn’t perform to our expectations. Whether it failed or not, that is left for them, but it didn’t perform well. “The situation we found ourselves, that is security challenges, killings of people all over, displacing people and the fact that people cannot access their farms is indeed worrisome.” He said the situation in the country led to the formation of The New Movement.
