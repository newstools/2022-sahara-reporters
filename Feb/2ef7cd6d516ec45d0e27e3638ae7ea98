Members of the Progressive Governor’s Forum (PGF) have agreed to zone the party’s national chairmanship position to the North Central ahead of the party’s national convention. The All Progressives Congress governors convened on Tuesday to deliberate and arrive at a consensus on the zoning of party offices but this ended in deadlock.  As of Tuesday, the APC governors were said to be divided on whether to zone the national chairmanship position to either the North Central or North East. But at their meeting which continued on Wednesday, the governors eventually settled for the North Central to produce the party’s national chairman, Leadership reports. According to a source who spoke with the newspaper, the governors also agreed to zone the party’s deputy national chairman and national secretary positions to the South. The party leaders and governors from the South will hold a meeting to take a final decision on micro-zoning the deputy national chairman and national secretary positions. Meanwhile, there are allegations that the APC governors may have tipped one of the aspirants from the North Central, George Akume, a former governor of Benue State and current minister of Special Duties and Intergovernmental Affairs as the consensus candidate for the position of national chairman. The source said, “Yes, the governors have finally agreed on zoning. They resolved that the national chairman should go to the North Central, while the South should produce the deputy national chairman and the national secretary at the forthcoming national convention. “It was even suggested that former governor of Benue State, George Akume, be picked as the consensus chairmanship candidate. For the deputy national chairman and national secretary, party leaders and governors from the South would have to meet and decide how to zone the positions among the zones.”
