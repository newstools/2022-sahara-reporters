The United States Mission Nigeria is set to commence a remote visa renewal process for Nigerians who qualify to renew their visas. The mission says the first phase of the scheme will commence in February, permitting applicants to drop off their travel documents at the US consulate in Lagos, The Nation reports.  This phase will allow a limited number of applicants, and applications may take up to two months to process. At the moment, the applications are limited to Lagos, however, the procedure will be extended to the American embassy in Abuja. “Applicants who meet the criteria may apply in Lagos until the service is extended to Abuja,” the mission was quoted as saying. “Please note that only one member of the family unit is required to drop off the application documents; children are not required to come to drop off in person. “Processing may take up to two months. Although we anticipate most cases will be processed within a few weeks, once you submit your travel documents, we will be unable to return these to you until your case has been completed.”
