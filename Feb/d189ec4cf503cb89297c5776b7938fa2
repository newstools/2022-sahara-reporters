A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, Daniel Bwala, has explained why he knows Vice President Yemi Osinbajo should not contest for the presidency in 2023. According to Bwala, if Osinbajo declares interest to run for the Presidency, it would be injurious to the presidential ambition of Bola Tinubu, the APC National Leader who already signified interest. Yemi Osinbajo There have been reports that Osinbajo would declare interest to run for the Presidency after the ruling party’s National Convention scheduled for February 26, 2021. Osinbajo’s spokesman, Laolu Akande, dismissed such claims describing them as false and speculative Bwala stressed that contrary to such reports, the Vice President had shot down such moves. Featuring on Channels Television on Tuesday, the APC chieftain said, “Yemi Osinbajo is not running for President. He is not interested. I think I know the wisdom behind why VP Osinbajo is not running and he is shooting down every attempt to point towards that. “He may have understood that the general principle of equity and fairness is that one good turn deserves another. He had a principal who supported him for eight years and because Asiwaju (Bola Tinubu) has indicated interest, morally, not legally, it would be injurious for the Vice President to express interest.” The APC chieftain also advised the Vice President to publicly downplay insinuations of him running for the presidency in 2023 to deter his supporters.
