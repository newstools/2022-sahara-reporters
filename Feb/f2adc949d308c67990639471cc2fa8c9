Human rights activist, Deji Adeyanju has described the All Progressives Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party as unfair for not considering the southeast region for the 2023 presidency. In a post on his Facebook page, Adeyanju said it is not fair that both the opposition and ruling parties are ignoring candidates from the region for the 2023 presidency. Deji Adeyanju He further opined that the southwest should not be considered for the presidency in 2023. He explained that the southwest produced a president who led Nigerians for eight years and produced a vice president for another eight years. Olusegun Obasanjo was President from 1999 to 2007 while Yemi Osinbajo, the current Vice President, is expected to complete his second term in office in 2023. Obasanjo and Osinbajo are from the southwest region. Adeyanju wrote: “Equity demands that power should naturally go to the South East. The southwest should not even be in the picture at all. “8yrs of OBJ + 8yrs of Osinbajo but this country is very unfair. However, both APC & PDP are not even considering SE at all.” The National Leader of the APC, Bola Tinubu has already declared interest to run for president in 2023. The former Governor of Lagos State is also from the southwest.
