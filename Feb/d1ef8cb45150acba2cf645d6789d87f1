The officers are Amarachukwu Asonta, a 27-year-old female officer of the, and her colleague, Adebayo Ajayi, 32, News Agency of Nigeria reports. Members of the NSCDC Justice Oyindamola Ogala ordered the remand of the officers after they pleaded not guilty to two counts of conspiracy and armed robbery filed by the Lagos State Directorate of Public Prosecutions (DPP).  The NSCDC officers allegedly committed the offences around 2.20 am on January 30, 2018, along Yaya Abatan Road, Ogba in Lagos, the state DPP Director, Dr Jide Martins, said. “The defendants and others who are now at large, while armed with guns and other offensive weapons highjacked an Iveco container truck with registration number – LSR746XD.  “The truck contained 1,700 cartons of Chelsea and Action Bitters drinks valued at N2.7 million, waybills, mobile phones and an unspecified amount of cash,” he said.  Martins said the court had to issue a bench warrant for the defendants as they had been evading arrest to defend themselves in the matter that started in 2018. He, therefore, requested that the defendants be remanded at a correctional centre, a request granted by Justice Ogala. Justice Ogala, after ordering the remand of the defendants at a correctional centre, adjourned the case till February 23 for the hearing of the bail application filed by the defence lawyer.
