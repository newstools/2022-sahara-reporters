Some hoodlums suspected to be members of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) and Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria (RTEAN) on Monday attacked motorists and commuters who were stranded in gridlock at the Apapa area of Lagos State. The hoodlums numbering over 50, armed with daggers and other cudgels descended on some journalists from television stations recording the traffic situation in the axis.  Hell was let loose when sympathisers tried to rescue the TV cameramen as the hoodlums went on rampage, attacking anyone in sight. The attack led to pandemonium as people scampered for safety while some motorists abandoned their vehicles and fled for fear of being stabbed. “Our correspondent, the two Television stations vehicles were already parked where they were asked to by the NARTO officials, unfortunately some hoodlums came from nowhere and asked them to leave that they were not supposed to park their operational vehicles there. It was in the process that arguments ensued and the Channels cameraman was stabbed, while Arise cameraman was also whisked away to unknown place by the hoodlums,” a Channels Television staff confirmed the incident.
