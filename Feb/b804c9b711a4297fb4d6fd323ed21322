Edo State governor, Godwin Obaseki, has said that Internet fraudsters popularly referred to as ‘Yahoo Boys’ must be brilliant to dupe people and their brilliance can be redirected to a better cause.Speaking on Friday at an education town hall meeting in the state, the governor said instead of condemning cyber fraud, the root cause should be addressed just like in the case of human trafficking. He added that 'Yahoo boys' must be very brilliant to carry out such illegal activities.“I am concerned. Cyber fraud and Yahoo culture are big issues. I am calling on everyone to please send as much information as you can to my office.“On Monday, I am going to see the chairman of EFCC. I am not condemning those involved. There must be a reason why that culture has become so prolific in Edo State. We must find the root cause and address them as we did in the days of trafficking.“Let’s see how we can correct it because these children must be very brilliant. The kind of things they do, how they hack into other people’s accounts. How do we re-direct that thinking into something more positive?” he said.
