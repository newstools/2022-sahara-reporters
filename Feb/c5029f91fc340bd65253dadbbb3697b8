A former Minister of Sports, Solomon Dalong said politicians beyond the age of 65 should consider being in the Senate and perish the idea of contesting for the presidency in 2023. Dalong, who was once part of septuagenarian Muhammadu Buhari's administration, said Nigeria now needs a vibrant and energetic person as President rather than elderly people. Solomon Dalong He stated this when he accompanied the founder of Abuja-based King Adebayo Film and Theatre Arts Network Television, Prince Adewole Adebayo, who officially declared his intention to run for the 2023 presidency in Abuja, Daily Post reports. Dalong said, “I believe that anyone who is 65 years and above should redirect their energies in becoming senators instead of running for the presidency. “They must vacate every executive position for the young ones. We have squandered their future since 1999 and we’ve not succeeded in building a future for them. “So, we should withdraw and allow them to take over their future. When they make it, they celebrate and when they mar it, they have themselves to blame. “I don’t want this endless ballgame of organising the future for the young ones. The fact is that we don’t want anyone who is 65 years to aspire for the presidency in Nigeria. “The office is too demanding; it’s too energetic and we don’t want anyone to go there and be so compassionate and delegate your functions to those you won’t be able to supervise because of your age.” The statement is perceived to be a direct message to some of the most popular aspirants who have declared interest in the position, such as National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Ahmed Tinubu and former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar. While Atiku Abubakar is currently 75 years old, Tinubu is headed for 70 years. The incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari is 79.
