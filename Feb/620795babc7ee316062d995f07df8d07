Precious Chikwendu, a former beauty queen was on Monday docked in a Federal High Court (FHC), Abuja for the attempted murder of her former husband and ex-minister, Femi Fani-Kayode.In a charge number: FHCABJ/CR/1/2022 filed by the Commissioner of Police, Federal Capital Territory (FCT), against Ms Chikwendu and three others, the ex-wife was said to have attempted to stab Fani-Kayode with a kitchen knife on November 24, 2018, at Asokoro, within the court jurisdiction. Others arraigned alongside Precious included Emmanuel Anakan, Prisca Chikwendu, and Osakwe Azubuike as the 1st, 3rd, and 4th defendants respectively, while others are said to be at large.In a 13-count charge dated and filed on January 7, the defendants were also alleged to have committed offences bordering on cybercrime, intimidation to kill Fani-Kayode by use of the internet, threat to kill one Lauretta in order to cause her to leave her relationship with Fani-Kayode.They were alleged to have criminally used the internet to send abusive messages with the intent to bully, defame and harass her ex-husband.They were alleged to have fabricated false evidence by deposing to a series of affidavits that Chief Fani-Kayode physically and sexually assaulted members of his domestic staff in inhuman conduct by causing same to be electronically published in a national daily.Chikwendu was also alleged to have, through her Facebook page, referred to Fani-Kayode as “Mr Short Fuse,” on December 7, 2021.She was also alleged to have published a false imputation against the ex-minjster “by referring to him as a person who is sexually incapacitated and that he is not the biological father of the four children she had for him as a wife.”The defendants, however, pleaded not guilty to all the counts, which are said to be punishable under Section 392 of the Penal Code, among others.The prosecuting counsel, John Ijagbemi, who prayed the court for a date to commence trial, said seven witnesses would testify in the matter.He said apart from the documentary evidence that would be tendered, electronic evidence had also been compiled to prosecute the case.Alex Ejesieme, SAN, counsel to the ex-wife (2nd defendant), urged the court to admit the defendants to bail based on the earlier administrative bail granted them by the police.Justice Ekwo, who fixed April 27, April 28 and April 29 for trial commencement, ordered the defendants to continue on the terms of administrative bail earlier granted.He directed the prosecution to submit all particulars of the defendants to the court registrar.Fani-Kayode, who had a hat-trick of marriages before meeting Precious with whom he has four sons, including a set of two-year-old triplets, had accused her of infidelity.Sources told SaharaReporters that the former Minister started physically abusing Precious from the first year of their marriage -- the same fate that befell her three predecessors.The violence, it was gathered, increased as the years went by.FFK as the ex-minister is often referred to, was said to have ordered Precious to abort her last pregnancy, claiming it did not belong to him.The sources said Precious ignored him but got savage beating, including on her belly for the recalcitrance.A source said Fani-Kayode always hit the woman violently in presence of their homehelps and sometimes threatened her with a gun by sticking the weapon in her mouth to warn her against squealing.He sometimes instructed his bodyguard to hit the ex-beauty queen.Fani-Kayode’s first wife, Saratu Attah, whom he married when he was 22, was also regularly pummelled by him.Sources said the woman, daughter of the late Adamu Attah, was viciously beaten for requesting a swimming pool in their home on Marine Road in Apapa, Lagos.FFK's next marriage was to Yemisi Odesanya, daughter of a judge. She is now known as Yemisi Wada after remarrying.In newspaper interviews, the woman told stories of Fani-Kayode's viciousness and lack of care for their daughters, the reason for which he was excluded from the marriage of one of them, Temitope, in 2014.Despite the disconnect between him and the children, FFK never fails to advertise his "love" for them on Facebook on their birthdays.
