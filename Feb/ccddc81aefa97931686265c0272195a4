President Muhammadu Buhari has lamented the ill-treatment being meted out to Nigerian nationals, and citizens of other African countries in Ukraine amid the ongoing war in the country. Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to the President (Media & Publicity) in a statement on Sunday said the Presidency understands the pain and fear confronting all people who find themselves in the middle of the crisis.  There have been reports, along with videos of Nigerians being turned back at Ukraine's borders in their attempt to exit the troubled country for neighbouring ones. The Presidency said it is aware of the situation, in the statement. It said, “While efforts to begin talks between Russia and Ukraine are underway, paramount on our minds is the safety and human rights of some four thousand Nigerian citizens and many others from friendly African nations today stranded in Ukraine.
