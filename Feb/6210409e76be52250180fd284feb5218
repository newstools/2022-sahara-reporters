A former Commissioner for health, Ahmed Gana; Special Adviser to the Governor on Social Investment, Dijjatu Bappa and a party stalwart, Jamil Isyaka Gwamna all resigned on Tuesday amid the crisis rocking the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC) in Gombe State. Some days ago, Gana defected to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).  In a letter dated February 1, 2022 to the Governor, the Special Adviser, Bappa informed the governor that her resignation was with immediate effect. She did not state the reason for her resignation but simply told the governor she had terminated her service. Meanwhile, Gombe business mogul and APC stalwart, Jamil Gwamna, has also left the party. Gwamna was a governorship aspirant of the opposition PDP in the 2019 general elections. He defected in 2019 to APC with his supporters to pave way for Governor Inuwa Yahaya’s election. Gwamna was also a strong stalwart who contested against former Governor Danjuma Goje in the defunct All Nigeria Peoples Party, (ANPP) in 2007. In his letter of resignation addressed to Jekadafari ward APC Chairman, Gwamna said his decision to leave the APC was after wide consultations with his family, political associates and supporters. The letter reads: “I write with all sense of humility and respect to notify you of my decision to resign from the ruling All Progressives Congress. I took the decision after wide consultations with my family, political associates and my supporters. “I appreciate all the privileges I enjoyed in the party while I was a member and I wish the party well.” Gwamna however did not clearly state his next political move although there are indications from some of the supporters that he may be returning to the PDP.
