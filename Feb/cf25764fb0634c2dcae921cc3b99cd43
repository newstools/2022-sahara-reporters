Peruvian President, Pedro Castillo, has sacked his Prime Minister, Hector Valer Pinto, three days after appointing him.This may not be unconnected to the recent outrage over revelations that Pinto was accused of domestic violence in 2016.





On Friday, Castillo said he had decided to "recompose" his cabinet, which means Prime Minister Pinto is out, France 24 reports.Castillo announced the change in a brief television address but had not mentioned Pinto by name.The opposition and even some cabinet ministers were up in arms about Pinto's presence in the government.When the President names a new cabinet, it will be his fourth since taking power six months ago.
