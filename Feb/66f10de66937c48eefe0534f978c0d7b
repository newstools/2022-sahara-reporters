Evans is stranding trial alongside ex-soldier Victor Aduba on a four-count charge of kidnapping and unlawful possession of firearms.He added that he was tortured and forced by embattled police officer, Abba Kyari, and “his boys” to admit to being a kidnapper.Explaining why he was seen in a jovial mood in the confessional video played in the court when prosecution presented its case, Evans said he was forced to act in that manner by the police.“The police told me to laugh and smile in the video. You do not know what I encountered in the hands of Abba Kyari and his boys. My eyes saw hell,” he said.Led in evidence by defence counsel, O.N Sonuga, he claimed to have met Ahamonu at the IG Guest House in Falomo.“One day at the IG Guest House, the police brought some documents and asked me to sign. I asked what the documents were for, but they didn’t answer me. They said that if I didn’t cooperate with them they would kill me.”He alleged that officers hurt him by “pressing cigarette butts on my body,” and threatening to kill him if he didn’t sign the documents.“They killed about six persons in my presence and I signed the document, I was not allowed to read it. I think it is the document that was used to bring me to court,” Evans said while reiterating that he didn’t know anything about the allegations before the court.Evans also told the court that no firearms were discovered in his home by the police.One of Evans alleged victim, Ahamonu and his wife, Chimebere, had on December 17, 2021 testified virtually how Mr Evans and his gang kidnapped him on June 23, 2014 on Kara Road off Osolo Way, Ajao Estate, Lagos.But while under cross-examination by the state prosecutor, Yusuf Sule, the suspected kidnapper vehemently denied knowing Ahamonu.When the prosecutor noted that Ahamonu had identified him when he testified virtually (via the Zoom app) in court, the suspect said he was easily identifiable.Responding to questions, Evans said he also did not provide medical documents proving his alleged torture by the police to the court.He, however, noted that while he was incarcerated, he had filed a fundamental human rights suit against the police at the Federal High Court, Lagos, over the alleged torture.The matter was adjourned until March 11, for continuation of trial by Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo.
