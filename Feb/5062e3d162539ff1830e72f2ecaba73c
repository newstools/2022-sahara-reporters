The Abuja Division of the Federal High Court will on Monday decide the fate of the embattled Deputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari, and four other suspects involved in the 25-kilogramme cocaine deal.The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency had filed an application in the court for the extension of the detention of the suspects. Abba Kyari



The 1999 Nigerian constitution clearly states that persons arrested or detained shall be brought before a court within a “reasonable time”.The reasonable time means a period of 24 hours when a court of competent jurisdiction is within a radius of 40 kilometres to the police station or a period of two days in any other case.The suspects have been in the custody of the agency since Monday, a period exceeding the constitutional time limit for charging an accused person to court.The application by the agency for a detention warrant of the suspects is to make their detention beyond the constitutional period legal.Others to be charged alongside Kyari are ACP Sunday J. Ubua; ASP Bawa James; Inspector Simon Agirgba and Inspector John Nuhu.The agency is also investigating assets the suspended police boss claimed to own in a video that has gone viral.
