Jeff Zucker, the longtime head of CNN and news industry titan, announced his resignation on Wednesday, a report by the American media outlet said.“As part of the investigation into Chris Cuomo’s tenure at CNN, I was asked about a consensual relationship with my closest colleague, someone I have worked with for more than 20 years,” Zucker wrote in an email to staff. “I acknowledged the relationship evolved in recent years. I was required to disclose it when it began but I didn’t. I was wrong." “As a result, I am resigning today,” he added.Chris Cuomo, the former CNN anchor who hosted the network’s 9 p.m. hour, was fired by the network late last year over his actions advising his brother, former New York Governor, Andrew Cuomo.While Zucker did not name the colleague with whom he had a relationship in his email, he was referring to Allison Gollust, the chief marketing officer and a senior vice president at CNN.Gollust acknowledged the relationship in a statement of her own that was reported by CNN.“Jeff and I have been close friends and professional partners for over 20 years,” she said. “Recently, our relationship changed during COVID. I regret that we didn’t disclose it at the right time. I’m incredibly proud of my time at CNN and look forward to continuing the great work we do every day.”
