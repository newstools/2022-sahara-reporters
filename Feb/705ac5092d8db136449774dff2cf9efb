Former National Legal Adviser of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Muiz Banire, has predicted that the party will soon implode due to its weak foundation. He spoke in a recent interview with Lagos-based Radio Now. According to him, the ruling party is known for violation of rule of law, and any organisation with disdain for rule of law, cannot stand the test of time.  Buttressing his point, the former Commissioner for Justice in Lagos said the APC is only made up of people who are only after power. He said: “Certainly the APC will implode. The foundation of the party itself is weak. We have several people, tendencies coming together to acquire power but they are unable to synergise. Conflict is tearing the party apart.” Banire said the leadership architecture of the APC is largely in the hands of governors, saying this explains why the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker Committee endorsed the faction controlled by state governors in all APC states. He recalled that he fought the party’s leadership as National Legal Adviser to ensure it follows the rule of law but it refused. Banire reiterated that he quit when his tenure expired having realised he was keeping a “bad company.”
