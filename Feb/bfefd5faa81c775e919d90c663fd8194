Former Kano State governor, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, has urged Nigerians to reject two political parties in the country, the All Progressives Congress (APC) and his party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2023. Kwankwaso said both the APC and PDP have nothing to show to warrant being re-elected in the coming 2023 elections. Governor Rabiu Kwankwaso The former governor has been said to be planning to leave the PDP in recent times following his frosty relationship with some top hierarchy of the party. Elected two times as governor and later as a senator on PDP's platform, Kwankwaso lambasted the two parties while featuring in a programme on local radio station, Nasara FM, in Kano on Saturday. He said the two parties are made up of envious people, adding that instead of voting them again, Nigerians should look for a party that can rescue them collectively. “I don’t see anything that either APC or PDP will show or tell Nigerians to get convinced and to vote for them in the coming 2023 elections. “So, I think people should now come to think of the right party and people to support and vote for so that we can rescue them from the present situation,” he said. The former presidential aspirant said coming back to the state political level wasn’t a good decision for him, but the need to rescue Kano made him take such an action. “In 2015 we gave the leadership of the state to some [people] thinking that they will make it, but not knowing that it won’t yield any positive outcome. That is why we are back to rescue our state," Kwankwaso.
