Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State says the state has lost about 900,000 houses and 5,000 classrooms to the Boko Haram insurgency ravaging the region. He also stated that the terrorists destroyed about 800 municipal buildings comprising police stations, traditional rulers’ houses, local government secretariats among others.  The governor made this known during a visit to Zamfara State in solidarity with his colleague, Bello Matawalle, over the recent activities of bandits. “We lost a total of about 900,000 to the insurgency. We lost about 5,000 classrooms in Borno State, 800 municipal buildings comprising police stations, traditional ruler houses, and local government secretariats. These are official figures, unofficial figures are more than this,” he said. Responding, Governor Matawalle commended Zulum for the concern and finding the time to visit Zamfara despite his own problems in Borno state. “Borno and Zamfara share a similar problem of terrorists’ attacks. I know how we share information, intelligence and the commitment of how to end these problems we inherited,” he said. “With this commitment and prayer and the support of our people, we shall triumph.” According to him, just like in Borno State, Zamfara has recorded losses in human and material form with no fewer than 25,000 orphans, 27,000 widows and over 3,000 houses destroyed with nearly 400,000 livestock rustled in the first eight years of the menace.
