A civic group, the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project, has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to direct his Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed, to widely publish a copy of the agreement the government recently signed with Twitter. In June 2021, the government announced the indefinite suspension of Twitter’s operation in Nigeria after the platform deleted tweets made by the President, who had threatened to treat members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) in the language they understood.  Months after, the President said he had directed that Twitter suspension be lifted — only if the conditions were met to allow citizens to use the platform for positive engagements. While announcing the lifting of the ban, the government noted that Twitter had agreed to meet the set out conditions. Reacting, SERAP in a post on its Twitter handle on Tuesday demanded for a copy of the agreement reached. “We're asking President Buhari to direct Alhaji Lai Mohammed to provide us with a copy of the 'agreement' recently signed with Twitter, Inc, and to widely publish the details of any such agreement. Please take a moment and sign the petition,” the tweet read.
