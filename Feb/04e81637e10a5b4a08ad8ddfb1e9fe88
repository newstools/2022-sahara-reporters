A Federal High Court (FHC) in Abuja, on Monday, directed the National Drugs Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) to allow disgraced Police chief, Abba Kyari, access to medical attention.Ruling on a bail application filed by Kyari, Justice Inyang Ekwo said Kyari should be allowed access to healthcare. He, however, added that the request for bail was overtaken by events in view of an earlier order by another judge of the same Federal High Court, Abuja, Justice Zainab Abubakar, granting the NDLEA permission to detain the suspended police officer for 14 days in the first instance.The judge said since a court of coordinate jurisdiction has ordered Kyari’s detention, he could no longer decide otherwise.“The only order I can make in addition to what I have said is that the respondent shall allow the applicant to his prescribed and verified medication while in custody,” Justice Ekwo said.The hearing of the Kyari’s fundamental rights enforcement suit has since been adjourned to March 15 in which the police chief is, among others, challenging his detention and seeking monetary compensation.Meanwhile, Kyari's lawyer, Cynthia Ikena, had claimed that her client was suffering from diabetes and that he was hypertensive, which informed why his drugs and food had to be regulated.She claimed to have been denied access to Kyari on Thursday when she tried to see him in the custody of the NDLEA.She added that since her client was arrested on February 12, 2021, he had not been on balanced diet despite his health challenges.Responding, NDLEA’s lawyer, Joseph Sunday argued that it was better to have Kyari remain in custody in order not to interfere with ongoing investigation.Sunday said although his client had concluded investigation on the drugs-related case, it was still investigating Kyari on money laundering issues.On Kyari’s claim to ill-health, Sunday said his client possessed sufficient capacity to deal with his (Kyari’s) health complaints.
