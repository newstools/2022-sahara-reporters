An octogenarian and retired cleric, Pastor Andrawus Gazama, has been appointed a local government council chairman in Adamawa State. Gazama, who is now the chairman of Madagali Local council, was among the 21 Council Chairmen named by Governor Ahmadu Fintiri recently.  His appointment has sparked outrage among young people who saw it as an affront on youth development in the state. The residents claimed Gazama is 85 years old. A People's Democratic Party (PDP) member, Ibrahim Saidu, described the governor's action as a move geared towards suppressing young people. "We have several qualified youths who are aspiring for the chairmanship but are neglected. I don't think it is good for our democracy and I don't think the old man's leadership is a good omen for our people. "He will only succeed in working for himself and his family. Many youths are leaving the party. Many young people in Madagali, the governor's local government are not happy with the development. "It's a huge challenge to the youth, the joy of the whole thing is that PDP is a party, not a religion; the youths will mobilise and leave the party for him and the old people he thinks can work for him," Saidu said. Similarly, the governor appointed his media aide, Solomon Kumangar, as a Permanent Secretary in the state civil service. Spokesperson for the governor, Humwashi Wonosikou, however, denied the allegation, saying “Pastor Andarawus Gazsma is not 85 years old.” He however did not state the exact age of the chairman.
