The incident was not given attention by the school authority.“That Torilla Wilson ‘m’ stated that Favour Benjamin ‘m’, Micheal Kashamu ‘m’ and Ansel Temile ‘m’ took the deceased to the third floor to prevent students on the second floor from witnessing how the deceased was being bullied and beaten. However, there is no concrete evidence to back up the claim. “In addition, from the records, one of the suspects, Edward, was issued a letter of working suspension by the school authority dated 23/05/2019 for inappropriate behaviuor, to clean his classroom on May 23, 2021 for eating popcorn while a teacher was in class and eventually spat some on the teacher. “That equally, another suspect, Kasamu Micheal, was issued a letter of suspension by the school authority, dated March 5, 2019 from school between for bullying and physically assaulting a fellow student, one Okeke, who has since left the school.”The police report further revealed how the suspects and other students constituted themselves into a clique that bullied and intimidated fellow students in the school.“It is evidently clear that some group of students constituted themselves into a clique that bullies and intimidates fellow students in the school.
