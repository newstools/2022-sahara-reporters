Junaidu Danjuma, the son of the traditional ruler of Gwombe community, Gwargwada chiefdom in the Kuje area council of Abuja, His Royal Highness (HRH) Danjuma Maji Jangaba, has been abducted by kidnappers. According to Daily Trust, the man conveying the kidnapped monarch’s son on a motorcycle, Kabiru Sani, was shot dead while attempting to escape.  Eleven villagers, including the wife of a Vice Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mrs Asabe Mohammed Koriya, were last week abducted in the same area. A resident of Gwombe, simply identified as Salihu, said the incident happened around 5:23 pm when the kidnappers, wielding sophisticated weapons, barricaded the Gwargwada-Gwombe Road. He said the traditional ruler’s son was returning from a neighbouring village, Rubochi, on a motorcycle, when the kidnappers suddenly appeared on the road. “It was upon sighting the kidnappers that the man who was conveying the chief’s son on a motorcycle attempted to escape, which made the kidnappers to open fire and kill him instantly, while they whisked away the chief’s son,” he said. The Agabe of Gwargwada-Ugbada, His Royal Highness (HRH) Alhaji Hussein Agabi Mam, confirmed the abduction of the son of Gwombe village chief.
