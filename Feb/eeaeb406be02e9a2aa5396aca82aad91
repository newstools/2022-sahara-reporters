A popular singer in Northern Nigeria, Haruna Abdullahi Aliyu, says he has regretted supporting Muhammadu Buhari to emerge as the President of Nigeria. Buhari emerged as the President of Nigeria in 2015 after winning election and returned for a second term in office in 2019.  Aliyu, who has carved a niche for himself in the Hausa music industry, particularly by singing songs to support prominent politicians, has expressed his disappointment with the Buhari regime. This comes as the president's approval rating continues to plummet, even within his own political stronghold, the core North. The Northern region has been ravaged by terror and violence, ranging from activities of Boko Haram terrorists to those of bandits killing and kidnapping for ransom. Aliyu, in a viral video, decried the handling of the country's security challenges amid high cost of living, particularly for the ordinary citizens. He asked why President Buhari could not deliver on his promises of tackling insecurity and building a vibrant economy. Speaking in Hausa, Aliyu said, "I deeply regret singing support songs for President Buhari because he's failed Nigerians, he's not kept his campaign promises. "I swear to God I regret supporting him (Buhari) on a number of issues badly handled by his administration. Of course, one may not regret everything but I regret anyway. "I regret because we supported him on based on his assurances that he was capable of tackling insecurity, corruption and bad economy. "As it is, the president has failed and hugely so. It is regrettable to have believed him this much," he added.
