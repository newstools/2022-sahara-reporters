The Oyo State Government has sealed the indigenous Premier Hotel situated at Mokola hill and an event centre located at Eleyele, Ibadan, for violating the environmental sanitation laws of the state. A statement by Wasiu Olatubosun, the commissioner for Information, Culture and Tourism, on Thursday obtained by SaharaReporters said the Odu’a Group-owned company and others constituted environmental nuisance in the state capital, Ibadan.  





A statement by Wasiu Olatubosun, the commissioner for Information, Culture and Tourism, on Thursday obtained by SaharaReporters said the Odu’a Group-owned company and others constituted environmental nuisance in the state capital, Ibadan.  The Commissioner for the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, Abiodun Oni, who led the enforcement team, reiterated that the need to seal up these facilities became necessary so as to put an end to the environmental nuisance in the state. The commissioner, who was appalled with the attitude of the management of Premier Hotel for accumulating heaps of wastes within their premises, wondered why the management failed to cooperate with the designated authorised waste collector, despite the seven-day ultimatum given to them to evacuate their wastes. 





“It is disheartening that despite efforts of this administration to provide an enabling and sustainable environment to residents, people still go ahead violating the environmental laws of the state whereas a filthy environment poses threats to individual's lives in the state. When sickness comes, it knows no boundaries,” the commissioner added.In the same development, over 80 shops were sealed at Sango market for non-compliance of environmental sanitation laws which include indiscriminate dumping of wastes on the road median, accommodating a filthy drainage at the frontage of their shops and non-compliance with the authorised waste collector while also the event centre was sealed for patronizing illegal waste collector.Oni who further emphasised that the enforcement would continue to take place said the people must understand the need to take care of the environment. "As citizens, proper waste disposal is a way of exercising their responsibilities as well as giving concrete support to the government as such, putting an end to the scourge of filthy environment,” the commissioner added.Meanwhile the team also embarked to Gbaremu market and Adelabu Complex at Challenge to sensitise the traders to the importance of having a clean, safe and healthy environment while also giving them stern warning to comply with the environmental sanitation laws or else would face its wrath.
