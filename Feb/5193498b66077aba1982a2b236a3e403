The Northern Elders Forum (NEF) has reacted to the attacks on the newly constructed Abia cattle market in Omumauzor in the Ukwa West Local Government Area of Abia State by unknown gunmen.The gunmen had on Tuesday night invaded the new cattle market in the community, killing about eight persons. Reacting, spokesman of the NEF, Hakeem Baba-Ahmed urged Igbos in the North to go about their legitimate businesses and not panic about any reprisal attack.He added that those targeting and killing northerners in the South East region should be “stopped and prosecuted” by the government.“Igbos in the North are not the killers of Northerners in the East. If they pursue legitimate business and live in peace, they have no reason to fear, and they should not be intimidated or threatened. Those killing Northerners in the East should be stopped and prosecuted. It’s enough,” Baba-Ahmed wrote on his Twitter account.
