Pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, has condemned the announced extension of the incarceration of Yoruba nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemo, also known as Sunday Igboho, by another six months. The group expressed disappointment and regret, while asserting that Sunday Igboho had spent over 200 days in Beninese government’s detention already. Sunday Igboho The national publicity secretary of the organisation, Jare Ajayi, stated that extending the detention of anyone who had not been convicted of any offence was against the law of any country that claimed to be guided by the rule of law. The group explained that the detention was much longer than it should be for a person who had not been convicted of any offence and a person who was not a criminal by any standard. The prolongation of his detention was a negation of the announcement on Saturday by the Abuja-based lawyer, Mr. Pelumi Olajengbesi, that Igboho would be released soon. The group commended Mr. Yomi Alliyu (SAN) for his doggedness in pursuing Igboho’s case and urged him to continue. It said, “Alliyu’s decision to resort to the ECOWAS Court to challenge the extension is quite welcomed. We are prayerful that the Court will reverse the decision by the Benin Court and set Igboho free soonest.” The organisation called on the Benin Republic government to rescind the ruling by its court in order to redeem its receding image on its respect for the rule of law.
