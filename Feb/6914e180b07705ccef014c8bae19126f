He also removed her tongue, breasts and other private parts, residents said.A community source told SaharaReporters that the suspect who was caught was mercilessly beaten by mob but men of the Oleh Police Station arrived in the community later."This has never happened in Olomoro community since I was born. This is a taboo. How can someone enter an old woman's house, a 87 years old woman for that matter, in the middle of the night? He killed her and removed her private parts? People are saying such a suspect should not be handed over to the police because he’s not mentally okay.“So you will just kill someone's mother like that and go free just like that all in the name of you are not mentally alright,” a resident fumed.When contacted, the Delta State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Bright Edafe, however denied that the deceased’s body parts were removed.He said, “None of her body parts was removed; the suspect who killed her was beaten by mob but he is a mentally ill person.”
