Leader of Pan Niger Delta Forum, PANDEF, Edwin Clark has said that Bola Tinubu, an All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential aspirant should go and rest instead of contesting for President in 2023. The elder statesman on Thursday cautioned the former Lagos governor, Tinubu, against contesting in the 2023 presidential election.  Clark made this known while Featuring on Arise TV, noting that he would rather vote for Vice President Yemi Osinbajo to become Nigeria’s next President. Clark, who said he is not aware that former President Goodluck Jonathan would be running for the presidency, described Osinbajo as an intelligent man who has what it takes to lead Nigeria in 2023. “I’m not aware of Jonathan running for the presidency. I’m a father to him and he has not informed me about such intentions. “The southwest is the most educated and sophisticated people in Nigeria, but Tinubu should go and rest. Other than the Igbos, I would vote for the Vice President; he is an intelligent fellow. “How many times have we heard Tinubu talking about the affairs of this nation or criticising those in power?” he asked.
