A video of some students at the University of Calabar (UNICAL), Cross River State, lamenting how they are writing their exams in the dark, has surfaced online.In the video now eliciting reactions on social media, some of the students were seen exiting an exam hall in the dark. A voice recording of the clip was done where the Vice-Chancellor of the institution, Prof Florence Obi, was lambasted for not buying generators for the school.A female student also lamented that apart from the lack of light to write their exams, the invigilators did not give them ample time."Look at the time we are finishing our exams, no light for us to use and write. They (invigilators) did not even allow us to finish our papers despite the fact that there was no light. Meanwhile our VC is abroad but she cannot buy a generator,” she said.The institution is yet to react to the video as of the time of this report.The video comes at a time when stakeholders have continued to express concern over the poor state of infrastructures in tertiary institutions across the country.The Academic Union of Universities (ASUU) has continued to threaten an indefinite strike over the poor situation of things at the nation's varsities.
