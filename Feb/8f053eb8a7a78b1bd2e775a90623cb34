A total of 965 terrorists alongside their families and 550 children laid down their weapons and surrendered to the Nigerian troops in Borno and Yobe states within three weeks, the Defence Headquarters has said.  This was made known by Benard Onyeuko, the Director, Defence Media Operations while addressing the press on Thursday on the activities of Nigerian troops from January 20 to February 10.  According to Onyeuko, troops of the Operation Hadin Kai recorded victory as 965 terrorists laid aside their weapons in different locations including Gamboru, Tumbumma, Kukawa, Baga, Gwoza, Mallam Fotori, Damboa, KirtaWulgo, Bun Yadi, Gujiba, Madiya all in Borno and Yobe states.  The success, he said, is attributed to the airstrikes which eliminated several ISWAP Commanders and their fighters.  He further noted that 104 of the 965 terrorists are from the Islamic State West African Province (ISWAP) Camp that was taken by troops at Marte.  "The surrendered terrorists have been properly documented and handed over to the appropriate authorities for necessary action,” he said.  Also, in Yobe and Borno states, no fewer than 120 fighters were neutralised by the troops while 50 of the terrorists were arrested, according to the Defence Headquarters. Weapons recovered from the terrorists include five gun trucks, 50 assorted arms and 200 rounds of different calibres of ammunition.
