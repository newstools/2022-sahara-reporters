National Leader of the All Progressives Congress and former Lagos State governor, Bola Tinubu has told Nigerian youths that they can only become president of the country after he has become one. The 69-year-old politician said this during a visit to the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi on Sunday.  Tinubu’s scheduled visit to Oyo town was part of his engagement with traditional rulers across the six geo-political regions in respect of his 2023 presidential ambition. Speaking in Yoruba, he said, "You won't give room for the elderly to pass and you haven't become president. What if you become president, you will chase us out of town?" "You will grow old, you will become president but I will become president first."
