Danjuma was the Minister of Defence during the administration of former President Olusegun Obasanjo. He has become one of the critics of the administration of President Buhari on the state of the nation, especially on insecurity. The former Defence Minister had accused the Nigerian government and the military of being behind the Fulani herdsmen onslaught across the country. Danjuma had also while speaking at the University of Ibadan, accused Yoruba leaders of being scared to criticise the administration of Buhari despite the alleged country’s obvious slide into anarchy. He had said that Nigerians would lose sleep if he revealed what he knew about happenings in the country.
