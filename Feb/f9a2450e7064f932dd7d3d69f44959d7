No fewer than 2000 investors have been allegedly defrauded of a total sum of N135million by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Detorrid Heritage Investment Nigeria Limited (DHIL), Gbenga Olaniyan.It was learnt that Olaniyan, businessman who defrauded his victims through introduction of a product known as Crime Alert Security Network, is being charged with N135million fraud. A witness of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Head of Counter-Terrorism and General Investigation Department, EFCC Ibadan Zonal office, Mrs Juliet Odogu, made the allegation while testifying before Justice Uche Agomoh of a Federal High Court in Ibadan, Oyo State on Monday.According to Odogu, the EFCC received over 2000 petitions from Nigerians that Olaniyan defrauded them of their hard-earned money after refusing to fulfil his obligation of repaying their dividends.The witness disclosed that investors paid between N5,000 and N9million depending on their subscriptions, tendering the documents containing the names, amount paid and receipts of each customer that petitioned the agency before the court.Defence counsel, Mr Richard Ogunwole, had earlier opposed the tendering of some documents by the EFCC. He contended that the documents were not admissible by the court because they were mere photocopies and not certified true copies.However, the judge overruled the objection and admitted the documents as exhibits against the defendant.Agomoh subsequently adjourned the matter till March 1, March 2 and March 3 for the continuation of trial.
