Following the controversial unveiling of Pastor Umo Eno as the "preferred successor" by the Akwa Ibom State Governor, Udom Emmanuel, there is currently disquiet in the state as more facts emerged on how the endorsement deal was brokered and sealed. SaharaReporters earlier reported how Governor Emmanuel on Sunday, unveiled his successor in a meeting which had former Governor, Victor Attah, few National Assembly members,  party leaders and some religious leaders in the state in attendance, known as "Fathers of Faith.” Eno Umo and Emmanuel Udom SaharaReporters on Wednesday gathered that the purported unveiling had caused disaffection within the ranks of the party as many were said to be ready for showdown.A member of the House of Representatives and governorship aspirant, Luke Onofiok, had reportedly stormed out of the meeting, denouncing the endorsement.A source who spoke to SaharaReporters disclosed that members of the State Party Executive of Peoples Democratic Party were taken aback by the decision and considered the action of the Governor as ill-advised and reckless, capable of destroying the party ahead of 2023 general elections."We were not consulted nor informed about the so-called stakeholders meeting. The governor just summoned few people and cajoled them to anoint the man without regard for party hierarchy and nomination processes,” a source said.
