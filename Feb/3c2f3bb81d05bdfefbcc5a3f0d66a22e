Human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore has described the presidential ambitions of a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and former governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi as dead on arrival.  Sowore disclosed this in a Facebook post on Wednesday titled ‘2023 as they come and evaporate so quickly!’ Omoyele Sowore
BBC Tinubu, a former governor of Lagos State, had in January declared his interest to contest in the 2023 presidential election.  He said, “Three weeks ago, you would think the election had been decided when Jagaban of Corruption, Bola Tinubu ‘declared’ his intention to run but soon as he discovered that his ambition was Dead on Arrival, he took his ambulance and fled to London!  Referring Osinbajo, who has not yet declared his intention to run but is believed to be nursing the ambition, the activist said, “Then #MinimeBuhari showed up, I am referring to the cowardly VP Professor Yemi Osinbajo, you would think he’d won the election but soon as he was challenged about his current abysmal assignment, hope began to fade for the law professor who constantly claimed his hands are tied.”  Obi, a former governor of Anambra State, was the vice-presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the 2019 election. Regarding the former governor, Sowore said, “It is now, the turn of the #Chinese Pandora PaPer man, Peter Obi! Ah, he’s gonna open a Gofundme to finance his campaign after all the funds looted from Anambra during his tenure as Governor! This too is dead upon discovery just as transparent dodo!  “The truth is that we’ve changed course, no more hanging our patrimony to deceitful, decrepit conmen that ruined Nigeria. We are not apologetic about it. The organic structures have taken over from the criminal transactional structures of the terminators.”
