The Zamfara State House of Assembly has begun a fresh move to impeach the deputy governor of the state, Mahdi Aliyu Gusau.The state lawmakers had in July 2021, accused Aliyu of attempting to cause unrest in the security-fragile state and thus needed to be summoned to explain his action. The deputy speaker of the House, Musa Bawa, at Friday’s plenary submitted a document requesting the impeachment of the deputy governor.Bawa, who is also the Chairman, House Committee on Public Account, moved a motion for the consideration of the request.He said, “I stand here before our able leader, Nasiru Mu’azu Magarya, to submit this document for the impeachment of the Deputy Governor, Zamfara State.”The speaker, Mr Magarya, acknowledged receipt of the document.“We will treat the document in accordance with the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended),” the speaker said.The deputy governor has refused to join Governor Matawalle to defect to the All Progressive Congress (APC).Aliyu, who is a son of a former Minister of Defence, Ali Gusau, argued that the Supreme Court awarded the electoral victory in 2019 to the PDP and not just its candidates.One other federal lawmaker from the state, Kabira Yahaya, also declined moving to the APC with the governor.
