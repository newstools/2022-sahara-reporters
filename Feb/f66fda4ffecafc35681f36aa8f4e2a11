Three persons have been killed and an unspecified number of others abducted in separate gun attacks on communities in three Local Government Areas of Sokoto State by terrorists, otherwise called bandits. The affected local councils are Tureta, Dange/Shuni and Bodinga.  The attacks, according to the Nation, were launched by suspected bandits fleeing from Sokoto-East amid a joint security offensive tagged “Operation Sahara Storm.” Chairman Dange/Shuni council, Alhaji Umar Gidan Gara, who confirmed the incidents, said three persons were shot dead by the bandits, who also abducted 17 persons across the attacked communities. Gidan Gara said negotiation for the release of the abductees was ongoing.
