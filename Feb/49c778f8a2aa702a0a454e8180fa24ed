Bashir El-Rufai, son of Kaduna State Governor has taken a swipe at a former Deputy Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Kingsley Moghalu and former Governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi, describing the former as the President of Nigeria's 'Twitter Branch’. Obi was the vice-presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2019 election while Kingsley Moghalu was the presidential candidate of the Young Progressive Party (YPP) in 2019.  Both of them lost to incumbent President, Muhammadu Buhari.  Bashir took to his Twitter account, attacking the two politicians in an attempt to discredit their presidential ambitions.  The governor’s son, who is known for making controversial comments on Twitter, insinuated in a tweet that Obi cannot win the presidential race, and that Moghalu is Nigeria’s “Twitter Branch” President.  The tweet read “Peter Obi cannot not win. Kingsley Moghalu is the undisputed President of Nigeria (Twitter Branch), please.”  Peter Obi cannot not win. Kingsley Moghalu is the undisputed President of Nigeria (Twitter Branch), please.  Obi had on Tuesday, February 1, tweeted that he was willing to run for President if his party, the PDP zoned the ticket to the South. He has since been trending on social media platforms. Obi  said, “Yes, I will step into the field to contest for the opportunity to serve this great country as President if my party, the PDP, zones the ticket to the South. But if it is thrown open, Nigerians will also hear from me."  Moghalu, on the other hand, said he would recontest the presidential election in 2023.  The two politicians have not responded to Bashir's comment.
