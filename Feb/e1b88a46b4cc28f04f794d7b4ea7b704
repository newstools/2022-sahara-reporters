A faction of the All Progressives Congress loyal to Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, has condemned the party’s governorship primary election in Osun State.In the unofficial results so far, Governor Gboyega Oyetola is in the clear lead across the state. Abiodun Agboola, spokesperson for the Osun APC faction loyal to Aregbesola in a statement said there were several irregularities in the conduct of the primary election.He said, “The Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrasaq led Osun APC Primary Election Committee should know that the primary lacks credibility and fairness.“It is necessary and important to inform the general public and Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrasaq-led Osun APC Primary Election Committee of the ongoing irregularities in the conduct of the primary election of the All Progressives Congress in Osun.“We strongly condemned the conduct of the primary election because it is nothing but a sham with a fraudulent process to favour Governor Adegboyega Oyetola. Verified information from the agents of Alhaji Moshood Adeoti, our governorship aspirant, has it that there are no record and result sheets in any of the 332 wards of the state.”The APC conducted the primary election across the 332 wards in the state using the direct mode which allows party members to choose the candidate of their choice.
