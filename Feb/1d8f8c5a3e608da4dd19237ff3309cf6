King West, a son of Musiliu ‘MC Oluomo’ Akinsanya, Chairman of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) in Lagos, has threatened people who post negative things about him. In a post shared on his Instastories, the son of the NURTW chieftain stated that such people should know they are at risk. He shared a video of a police officer saluting him and opening the door of his car before posting the warning for his haters to ponder on.“You post this s*** about me, I will look and smile but just know you are at risk because anywhere my people see you, you are a gunner,” he wrote.In December 2021, King West also slammed those who called his father an “uneducated tout”. The Lagos NURTW chairman has been in the spotlight on numerous occasions over allegations of violence and his perceived low education profile. In 2020, Oluomo spoke of the widespread controversy about his educational background. He recalled how problems with family members left him struggling to make ends meet during childhood. “When those who don’t know me meet me, they’ll say they were expecting some huge person or tout that smokes weed because of the type of job I do,” the transport businessman had said in Yoruba.
