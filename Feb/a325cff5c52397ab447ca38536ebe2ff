This man keeps circling our car. He tried to lunge for me.“The military just knocked on our window and told us to go now so we are moving the car. The locals are complaining about us to the military and the military is assisting them. We are being compliant in order to remain safe.“UPDATE: the British embassy has been in touch and said they will assist.”
