No fewer than 11 civilians were killed in Russian shelling on Ukraine’s second most populated city, Kharkiv on Monday.This was made known by the regional governor Oleg Sinegubov, adding that dozens more had been injured, according to reports by the APP. Sinegubov said in a Telegram message, “The Russian enemy is bombing residential areas. As a result of the bombardments that are ongoing, we cannot call on the emergency services… currently there are 11 dead and dozens wounded.”This is despite high-level talks between Ukraine and Russia which started at the Belarussian border on Monday.According to a report by Reuters, the talks are being held on the border with strong Russian ally Belarus, where a referendum on Sunday approved a new constitution ditching the country's non-nuclear status at a time when the former Soviet republic has become a launch pad for Russian troops invading Ukraine.Meanwhile, ABC news reports that the Ukrainian troops and volunteer territorial defence have been able to stop Russian special forces from pushing into Kharkiv after indiscriminately bombarding the city with artillery.
