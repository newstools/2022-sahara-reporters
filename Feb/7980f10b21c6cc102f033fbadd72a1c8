Online payment app, Opay, has been accused by a young man of defrauding him of hard-earned cash. The customer, who purchased items on Buffalo Mall on Opay App, disclosed that after paying for goods, the purchases were never delivered and neither was his money returned. According to the complainant, all efforts to get his funds back have been frustrated by Opay, who claimed not to be involved in the fraud. "Opay app has a store where they sell electronics, phones, fan, radio and other items. They call the store Buffalo Mall inside Opay app. "On January 3, 2022, I placed an order for a phone and it was to be delivered by January 27. I made complete payment for the item. "After a long period, no delivery was made to me, so when I called Opay customer care, they gave out a foreign number that I should call Buffalo Mall directly for my order. I had no direct contact with Buffalo Mall but Opay, they gave their approval before the said transaction took place. "A few days later when I tried to check the app, I realised that Buffalo Mall had been deleted including all our transaction details.“I tried the foreign number they gave to me but there was no response and since then I have been calling Opay customer service, mailing them but they have been putting my call on hold, telling me to go and look for Buffalo Mall myself. At the moment, Opay doesn't even respond to my complaint again," he said.Efforts to get the company to react were not successful as the mobile number put on its website as the official phone line was not reachable.
