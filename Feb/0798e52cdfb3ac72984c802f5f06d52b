The Nigeria Union of Agriculture and Allied Employees (NUAAE) on Tuesday staged a protest at the headquarters of the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission in Abuja after accusing the agency of conniving with its suspended National President, Simon Anchaver, over N150million alleged fraud. The protesters who chanted songs at the entrance of the agency, displayed placards and banners with inscriptions such as "ICPC safe our Union," "Anchaver you are not bigger than law," and all.  SaharaReporters monitored the protest where the union accused the suspended President of allegedly collecting N150million from a bank on behalf of 112 numbers of the union without their consent. They alleged that over N200million was diverted into his brother, Angbian Simon’s personal account. The National Treasurer of NUAAE, Obafemi Oyenubi, who led the protest, said the issues had been tabled before the ICPC since 2021 but the agency failed to probe Anchaver. The union had in December 2021 suspended its National President, Anchaver, and the General Secretary of the association, Aitekhuehi Ededuan, indefinitely by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) Monitoring Team and NUAAE Central Working Committee (CWC) on alleged criminal breach of agreement in accordance with NUAAE constitution.
