He added that the service had transferred the case of Ntari to the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) for prosecution upon the completion of the investigation.The DG claimed that the AGF is now responsible for his detention at Military Holding Facility, Wawa, Niger State.Bichi claimed that it is the Nigerian Army that controls the facility and not the DSS; therefore, the DSS could not release or produce the suspect as ordered by the court on November 29, 2022.He added that a prima facie case of terrorism had been established against the Respondents.The motion read in part, "That upon completion of investigation, the case file of the Respondents was forwarded to the Attorney-General of the Federation for prosecution while the Respondents were transferred to the Miltary facility at Wawa in Niger State where terrorists are being tried."That the Order of Court was still in subsistence when the Applicant moved the Respondents to Military Holding Facility, Wawa, Kainji,Niger State for speedy prosecution, as a prima facie case of terrorism, has been established against the Respondents."That I know as a fact that the Respondents and their case files are no longer in the Applicant's custody and as such, the Applicant cannot account for them."That the Applicant did not disobey the Court Order of 29 November, 2021 out of disrespect, as the Respondents are no longer in the Applicant's custody."That the Respondent is not in the habit of disregarding Court Orders."Counsel for Danladi, P. D. Pius had asked the court to commence contempt proceedings against the DG of the DSS for failure to release his client who has been in detention since May 2021. Meanwhile, the lawyer had also threatened to sue the AGF, Nigerian Army, and the DSS for flagrant disobedience to the court order. He is also seeking N100 billion as damages for the abuse of the fundamental rights of his client.
