Students of D.S Adegbenro ICT Polytechnic, Itori, Ogun State, on Wednesday morning, blocked the Lagos-Abeokuta highway, over the alleged abduction of two students of the institution.Suspected gunmen had attacked a student’s hostel around 1am at Afowowa, Ewekoro Local Government Area of Ogun. 





The students said they were angry, alleging that the police refused to respond to distress calls, saying the attack lasted for almost four hours, unhindered.“The gunmen attacked a hostel at Afowowa and operated for almost four hours. They made away with laptops and other belongings of our colleagues. We called the police but there was no response. Later, the police said their vehicle was not in good condition.“When they finally arrived, they said the students should lead in facing the gunmen. One of the students was shot in the leg and others were badly injured. That is why we took to the street to protest,” one of the students said.The students had earlier marched to the police station before barricading the main road linking Abeokuta with Sango-Ota and Lagos.This development led to traffic gridlock on the highway, as all entreaties by commuters and motorists to vacate the highway and allowed the free flow of traffic failed.
