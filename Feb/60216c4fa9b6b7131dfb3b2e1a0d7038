SaharaReporters on Tuesday that heavy gunfire was heard in the capital of Guinea-Bissau near a government compound, where a cabinet meeting was being held.

He affirmed that some of the perpetrators had been arrested. “It wasn’t just a coup,” he said. “It was an attempt to kill the president, the prime minister and the entire cabinet.” “Armed attackers tried to enter the building but were repelled.
