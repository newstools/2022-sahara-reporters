Abdulmalik Tanko, the self-confessed killer of Hanifa Abubakar, a five-year-old girl has denied the murder charges levelled against him.  The police had in January paraded Tanko after confessing to the murder of the girl. He is the proprietor of Noble Kids Comprehensive College, the school Hanifa attended.  The school owner had earlier confessed to the murder while answering questions on his involvement in the crime.  He had said he killed Hanifa with “rat poison” and buried her body on the school premises with the help of a friend.  Tanko was subsequently charged with Criminal Conspiracy, Kidnapping, Concealing/Keeping in Confinement a Kidnapped Person and Culpable Homicide, contrary to Sections 97, 274, 277 and 221 of the Penal Code by the Kano State Government.  When the charges were read to him on Monday, he pleaded not guilty to all the charges.  The presiding judge however adjourned sitting till February 9 and ordered Tanko and other suspects to be remanded in prison.
