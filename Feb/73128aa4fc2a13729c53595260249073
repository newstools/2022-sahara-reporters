Suspected cult members have murdered a retired Assistant Commissioner of Police in Imo State, Christian Kpatuma.  The retired police officer cum lawyer was, on Wednesday, killed at his residence in Agwa, Oguta Local Government Area of Imo State.  The murder of the police chief, popularly known as ‘Hippies’ has caused apprehension among residents of the area. Cult members are said to have taken over the Agwa community.  A prominent citizen of the community who spoke with the Nation, appealed to Governor Hope Uzodinma to bring those who murdered the late assistant commissioner of police to justice.  “I call on the Governor of Imo State to direct the security agencies to Agwa with a view to hunting these cultists and their sponsors and financiers until they are all brought to book.  “Agwa people now live in great fear, in spite of the fact that her well-meaning sons and daughters suffered to build a Police Divisional Headquarters (adjudged to be the best in Imo State), which was commissioned barely three days ago together with a Vigilante Service. I am greatly pained,” he said.  The state police spokesman, Michael Abattam, said he had heard about the incident but had yet to get details from the Divisional Police Officer in the area.  “I have heard about it, but I want to get the details from the Divisional Police Officer in the area and get back to you,” he was quoted as saying.
