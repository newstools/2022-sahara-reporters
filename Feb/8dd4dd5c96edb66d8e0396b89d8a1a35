 The 2022 proposed budget of the Nigerian government is littered with frivolous items worth billions of naira inserted by the Senator representing Anambra North Senatorial District in the Senate, Stella Oduah, a report by a non-governmental organisation, has revealed. According to the NGO in a letter sent to SaharaReporters, Oduah is allegedly using her position as the Deputy Chairman of Senate Committee on Appropriations to siphon taxpayers’ money.  The letter dated January 20, 2022, was jointly signed by the organisation's Executive Chairman, Abubakar Galadanchi; Project Director, Barrister Ossai Festus; and Protem Secretary, Oluwole Idris. President Muhammadu Buhari had in October 2021 presented a budget of N16.39 trillion for 2022 to the Joint Session of the National Assembly. But the NGO in the letter urged the President and the Minister of Finance not to fund and implement “these fictitious training and empowerment line items of a total of N4,123,965,973.” The letter read, “We are a non-governmental, non-profitable and non-partisan organisation committed to eradicating corruption and also campaigning for good governance in Nigeria. “Sir, we bring to your attention the continuous siphoning of Nigerians’ hard-earned and taxpayers’ money by Senator Stella Oduah using Nigerian budget as a tool through her office as Deputy Chairman, Senate Committee on Appropriations. “This she did seamlessly in 2020 and 2021 budgets by padding and inserting several fictitious training and empowerment line items in the 2020 and 2021 budgets.
