The Igbos for Progressive and United Nationhood (IPAN) has condemned the gruesome murder of some Northern traders and their cows in Omumauzor, Ukwa West Local Government Area of Abia State by unknown gunmen. Some unknown gunmen last Tuesday invaded the new cattle market in the community, killing about 8 persons.  IPAN National President, Lawrence Onuzulike in a statement on Sunday described the incident as barbaric and heartless. Onuzulike called on Igbo leaders, especially those eyeing the presidential seat in 2023, to speak out and stop pretending, for the sake of their egocentric reasons. "IPAN calls on Northerners to please exercise patience and not to retaliate as the acts are carried out by uninformed people who are bent on bringing calamity against Igbo people in the north,” he said. "We call on Northerners to please exercise patience and not to retaliate as the acts are carried out for uninformed people who are bent on bringing calamity against Igbo people in the north. “IPAN wonders why Igbo leaders, especially those aspiring to become president of Nigeria, are not vehemently condemning these savage acts. "Are Ndigbo really comfortable with the current situation of things in the South East? What are our Igbo leaders doing? "We are trying so hard to understand what exactly some of the Igbo leaders are benefitting from the current situation of things in the South East. "No doubt, their actions and inactions led us to where we are today, and their silence in the face of these calamities is disturbing. We charge them to speak. "And to the Governor of Abia State, Okezie Ikpeazu, we must stress that this is not the time to just condemn the barbaric act, but time to act and get the killers quickly apprehended.”
