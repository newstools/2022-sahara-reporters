A Ukrainian military plane with as many as 14 people on board has crashed near Kyiv. AFP, quoting Ukrainian emergency services, said the plane crashed near the capital Kyiv.  About 40 people have been killed so far in attacks by Russian troops on Ukraine. The Ukrainian Army had earlier claimed that a Russian plane was shot down over Luhansk Region. Russia has seized control of two villages to the east of Ukraine after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a war on Ukraine. Ahead of the invasion, Putin in a televised speech appealed to Ukrainian soldiers to lay down their arms and go home. He said the clashes between Russian and Ukrainian forces are 'inevitable' and the special military action was 'aimed at demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine'.
