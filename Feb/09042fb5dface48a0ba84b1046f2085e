A meeting scheduled for Tuesday between President Muhammadu Buhari and members of the Progressive Governors’ Forum (PGF) was cancelled as the president jet off to Belgium. The focus of the meeting was believed to be on the forthcoming convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC), especially issues surrounding the modalities and the setting up of sub-committees to ensure the success of the exercise, Daily Trust reports.  Meanwhile, most of the APC governors had arrived in Abuja on Monday for the Tuesday meeting before they were informed of the cancellation through the PGF secretariat.

Governors Hope Uzodinma of Imo State and Yahaya Bello of Kogi State, who had scheduled meetings with the president, were said to have equally prepared to attend the meeting believed to have been called off because it was almost Buhari’s departure time for the trip to Belgium. Meanwhile, Buhari received the Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Omo-Agege and the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Ahmed Idris Wase at the State House, Abuja who jointly headed the Constitution Review Committee.
