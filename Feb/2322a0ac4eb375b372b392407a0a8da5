A young girl was rescued from jumping into the lagoon outward Iyana Oworo end of the bridge by officials of Rapid Response Squad (RRS) on patrol of 3rd Mainland Bridge, on Thursday.The teenager who was restrained by the officers from committing suicide by jumping into the lagoon in a conversation revealed that “I was beaten at home, that is why I ran away to commit suicide.” The officers’ attention was said to have been drawn to the lady by a dispatch rider before racing to the scene to restrain her from jumping into the lagoon.She has been conveyed to Iyana Oworo Police division, where efforts are in progress to contact family members.A 21-year-old man, Odunare Olalekan, had in December 2021 committed suicide by jumping into a lagoon at the Epe end in the Epe Local Government Area of Lagos State.A viral video showed Olalekan sitting on the handrail of Berger Bridge and suddenly jumping into the lagoon.A voice in the video was heard asking Olalekan what was wrong with him, but soon after, he jumped to his likely death.Sources had said that Olalekan, who left a one-year-old baby behind, had told his father, Mr Odunare, in the early hours of Tuesday to pray for him.“He also told his girlfriend who is 19 years old to take care of his baby. Thereafter, he left to the bridge side to commit suicide by jumping inside the creek, without giving any reason for such action to his family,” a source close to the family said.Olalekan was said to be a holder of an Ordinary National Diploma (OND) certificate and a worker at Alaro City, a mega estate along the Lekki-Epe Expressway.His body had yet to be found weeks after as rescue efforts were being hampered by the massive presence of hyacinths in the lagoon.
