Former Registrar of the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board, Prof Dibu Ojerinde, will now stand in trial following a failed attempt to settle out-of-court with the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission. Ojerinde who was arraigned on Tuesday before the Federal High Court in Abuja over an alleged N5billion fraud had asked the trial Judge, Justice Obiora Egwuatu, to give him 24 hours to settle himself with ICPC through a plea bargain instead of a formal trial. Prof. Dibu Ojerinde-JAMB Registrar His lead counsel, Ibrahim Ishyaku (SAN), informed the court that his client preferred an out-of-court settlement known as a plea bargain to resolve the matter. The senior lawyer informed the judge that the trial could commence if, after 24 hours, the matter could not be resolved. However, the plea bargain failed as both parties were unable to agree on acceptable terms of the settlement. According to reports, Ojerinde agreed to surrender all assets acquired while serving governments while the ICPC insisted that it would take all assets so far traced to him including schools, colonies and cash in banks standing in the name of the defendant.
