The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has postponed its national convention slated for February 26, 2022, SaharaReporters has gathered.  It was learnt that the convention was postponed over some unresolved issues in the party.  The party has however notified the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of its intention to hold its zonal congresses on March 26.  In accordance with Section 85 (1) of the Electoral Act (2010) as amended, all political parties in the country are mandated to give the commission at least a 21-day notice before holding a convention.  According to the APC constitution, zonal congresses are expected to be held weeks before the national convention.  “Now that zonal congresses are to be held on Saturday, March 26, 2022, that means the date of the national convention has been shifted. Those to emerge from the zonal congresses are part of delegates for the national congress,” a party chieftain told SaharaReporters.
