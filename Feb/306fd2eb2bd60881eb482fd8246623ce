The National Agency for the Control of AIDS (NACA) has advised young Nigerians to go for tests to ascertain their HIV status and avoid risky behaviours on Monday, Valentine’s Day. This was contained in a statement issued by the director-general of NACA, Dr Gambo Aliyu.  Aliyu stated that the new HIV infection is being recorded in Nigerians between the ages of 15 and 24. He, therefore, advised Nigerians to get tested. “New HIV infection is currently highest among young people aged 15-24 years. It is important to reduce this worrying trend among Nigerian youths by encouraging faithful relationships for those who cannot abstain from sex to practice safer sex,” he said. The NACA boss further urged Nigerians, especially the youths, to express love within the context of caring deeply for their loved ones and avoid behaviour that will make them vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. He said, “As we express love on this day, remember to love wisely. As members of the wider society, your health and productivity are vital to the future of our country. So, I urge you to avoid risky behaviours as we commemorate Valentine’s Day. Love wisely, share love, not HIV. Get an HIV test today.”
