Commercial drivers along the Gusau-Magami Road in Zamfara State on Wednesday embarked on an indefinite strike over persistent attacks by bandits on the road. The drivers called on government to deploy adequate security in the area, which had been taken over by the hoodlums.  The motorists were said to have abandoned the road on Tuesday, which crippled the socio-economic activities of people living along the road. According to Punch, one of the drivers, Musa Idris, said the bandits were always seen on the road, especially on market days, when there were a lot of people. He said at least 15 commercial drivers and several passengers were abducted in just two weeks. He added that some vehicles were also burnt by the hoodlums. “We have lost many of our colleagues, who were killed by bandits on that road, and currently, they are holding about 15 drivers and demanding payment of ransom. “We are forced to embark on strike in order to draw the attention of both Zamfara State and the Federal Government to do something to protect our lives.” Another driver lamented that his Golf car was burnt by bandits, noting that he escaped narrowly from being kidnapped. “I escaped from being kidnapped because when they blocked the road two weeks ago, I was lucky to run away. “There were over 10 vehicles, including mine, which were stopped by the bandits on that day and when they were trying to abduct the passengers, I ran into the bush, leaving the vehicle on the road. “They kidnapped many passengers and later set my vehicle on fire,” he said.
