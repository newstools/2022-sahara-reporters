A bill to abolish secondary school certificates as a qualification to run for president, governor and a seat in the National Assembly has passed first reading in the House of Representatives. The bill was sponsored by Oriyomi Onanuga, a member representing Ikenne/Shagamu/Remo constituency in Ogun State.  The bill seeks to replace the use of secondary school certificate with a degree or its equivalent. The bill, which was introduced on Tuesday, also seeks to amend sections 66, 106, 131 and 171 of the 1999 Constitution as amended. If it is passed into law, politicians will be required to have a minimum qualification of Bachelor’s Degree, Higher National Diploma, Nigeria Defence Academy (NDA) certificate and other equivalent degrees to contest to become lawmakers, governors and president. A date will have to be fixed for the second reading of the bill.
