Boko Haram insurgents are currently attacking Damboa-Biu Road in Borno Road in a bid to abduct some commuters, SaharaReporters has learnt. An alert sent to SaharaReporters confirmed that the insurgents had mobilised with the intent to carry out a kidnapping operation while it was not yet clear if the military authorities got the intelligence or were heading to the area. SaharaReporters Media “Boko Haram/ISWAP have staged a snapshot road block along Damboa-Bu Road right now. Their intention is to abduct commuters plying the road,” a source said. Since the death of JAS leader, Abubakar Shekau, ISWAP has been consolidating its grip on locations around Lake Chad. Recently, it appointed Wali Sani Shuwaram, a 45-year-old as the new leader of ISWAP in Lake Chad. The sect’s membership has swollen with the defection of hundreds of Boko Haram fighters under Shekau. The Nigerian Army has repeatedly claimed that insurgency had been largely defeated and frequently underplays any losses. The terror group has caused over 50,000 deaths and displaced millions of people mainly in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states.
