Bandits have abducted a mother, two children and servants from a traditional ruler’s residence in Sokoto State. SaharaReporters learnt that the terrorists on Tuesday night stormed the residence of the traditional ruler of Ambarura in the Illela Local Government Area and whisked away a mother with her two children and several house maids.  Bello Isa Ambarura, member of the Parliament for Illela Constituency, said the attackers invaded the Ambarura chief’s residence, abducting girls between the ages of 12 and 13, and their mother. He said, “We have been facing these problems for a long time, especially in the east of Sokoto, for example towns like Gwadabawa, Raba, Wurno, Isa, Sabon Birni and others, because they are all on the border. "The security agencies are trying their best but the situation is getting worse, despite deployment of security forces in the area to make sure that the right thing is done." When contacted for confirmation the spokesperson for the Sokoto command of the Nigeria Police, said he would investigate and call back, but as of the time of filing this report, he didn't call. Militants continue to carry out attacks in parts of Sokoto State, resulting in the loss of lives and property, besides kidnapping for ransom.
