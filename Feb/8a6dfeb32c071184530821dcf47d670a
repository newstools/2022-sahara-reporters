Suspected bandits have killed seven persons in an attack on three communities in the Zango Kataf Local Government Area of Kaduna State. The attack was said to have occurred on Tuesday night.  According to the Southern Kaduna Peoples Union Public Relations Officer, Mr Luka Binniya, the gunmen burnt houses in Sabon Kaura, Zaman Dabo and Chibob communities in what could be described as a “coordinated attack”. Binniya explained that the terrorists invaded the villages in large numbers and opened fire on residents, destroying property worth millions of naira. “The terrorists also took advantage of the absence of the military in the early hours of Tuesday at a checkpoint between Ungwan Wakili and Abuyab and vandalised the only bridge linking the two communities. “As I am talking to you, not even a motorcycle can cross that bridge now. Something urgent needs to be done in order to fix the bridge because the people in those communities are living at the mercy of those terrorists,” he added. The development comes days after seven persons were confirmed dead following an attack on Kerawa village in the Igabi local government area.
