Terrorists have shot a prospective Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, JAMB, candidate from Government Science Secondary School, Birnin-Gwari in Kaduna State. The victim was on his way to register for the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME), in Kaduna, when he was attacked by the terrorists.  UTME is a computer-based standardised examination for prospective undergraduates in Nigeria. He, however, escaped with bullet wounds, but seven other road users were not that lucky. Ibrahim Abubakar Nagwari, Chairman, Birnin Gwari Vanguard for Security and Good Governance, in a statement, explained that the terrorists killed seven locals in the community. He lamented the resurgence of violence in the area, saying it had become a daily experience for the locals who are being terrorised by the insurgents. He further explained that three other people escaped with mild wounds, adding that 57 others were abducted. According to him, “the nightmare of armed banditry along Birnin-Gwari-Kaduna highway has further deteriorated in the last 24 hours".
