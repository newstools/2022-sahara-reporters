Terrorists, otherwise known as bandits, have killed the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) in Magamar Jibia, Jibia Local Government Area of Katsina State. The gunmen, who stormed the village on Tuesday evening with motorcycles, also killed a yet–to-be-ascertained number of villagers.  SaharaReporters gathered that a senior military officer and the army commandant in the LGA was also injured during the attack that lasted for over two hours. The attack comes a few days after about 13 people were killed and many others abducted by bandits in three Katsina communities. The three communities, Guga, Gidan Kanawa and Dukawa, are in the Bakori and Funtua Local Government Area, all in the southern part of the state sharing boundaries with Kaduna. Katsina, despite being the home state of President Muhammadu Buhari has witnessed sporadic attacks by bandits and kidnappers that have claimed the lives of many.
