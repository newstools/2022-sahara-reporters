Residents of Idi-Apa Village in Pakumo Ward under Moro Local Government Area of Kwara State have lamented the source of water in the community. They informed officers from the anti-corruption civil society organisation, Elites Network for Sustainable Development, that they share the pond in the community with cows.  Leader of the village, Ahmed Ayinde, said efforts have been made to bring the situation to the attention of the state government all to no avail. He stated this during an interview with AbdulRaheem Olayemi Abdul Razak, the ENetSuD monitoring officer for Moro Local Government. In videos obtained by SaharaReporters, it evident that the source of water was an unguarded man-made pond, which is coloured and stagnant. Ayinde said, “This is the water we're drinking. We share with cows, when animals are done drinking, we take our portion. We've cried to the government but no one is ready to help us. “Potable water, that's the major need in our lives. We are calling on the government to help us, we have no other source of help.”
