The UK Chief of Defence Staff, Admiral Sir Tony Radakin has disclosed that his country is affected by several security threats, just like Nigeria.  This was made known on his official handle on Wednesday, after a three-day talk with Nigeria’s Chief of Defence Staff, General Leo Irabor, and the National Security Adviser (NSA), Babagana Munguno.  “Meeting my Nigerian counterpart General Lucky Irabor for discussions aimed at furthering our shared prosperity goals, democratic values, and mutual security interests.  “Threats from terrorism, organised crime & maritime security affect the UK & Nigeria alike. Today’s talks build on the work of the UK military advisory team, together with @HMSTrent’s visit to Lagos in October which included exercises in the Gulf of Guinea.”  However, the UK High Commissioner to Nigeria, Catriona Laing on Thursday also tweeted describing the meeting as part of efforts to deepen security and defence tie between both nations.  “Great to be part of a brilliant few days in London deepening the UK-Nigeria security and defence partnership.  “Really strong progress on areas like tackling organised crime and civilian security. Looking forward to the next dialogue!”  The meeting, which discussed a range of issues including counter-terrorism, organised crime, and human rights, also had the UK NSA, Sir Stephen Lovegrove, among others, in attendance.
