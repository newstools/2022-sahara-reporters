A Federal High Court in Abuja has given an interim order forfeiting 10 properties of a former governor of Zamfara State, Abdulaziz Yari, to the Nigerian government. Some of the properties to be forfeited are located in the choice parts of Abuja, Zamfara, Kaduna and the US, according to the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related offences Commission (ICPC).

 Abdulaziz Yari Justice Obiora Egwuatu on Wednesday gave the order while ruling on an ex-parte application filed by the counsel for the ICPC, Osuobeni Ekoi Akponimisingha. Another Federal High Court had in 2021 ordered the final forfeiture of N278.9 million, including dollars, said to belong to the former governor. Justice Egwuatu said the interim order granted would enable the ICPC to conclude its investigation, following which the commission could apply for final forfeiture. The judge ordered the ICPC to publicise the order to give anyone with interest in the properties time to prove why they should not be permanently forfeited to the Nigerian Government.
