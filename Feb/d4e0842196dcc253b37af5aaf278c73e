The Centre for Public Accountability (CPA) has restated its demand for the diligent prosecution of suspects, involved in the gruesome murder of Timothy Adegoke, a Master’s Degree student of the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife, Osun State, at Hilton Hotel. The group called on the judiciary to ensure the speedy trial of the suspects after the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, moved them to Osun State.  CPA noted that it was not unaware of alleged attempts to truncate the course of justice, given the lack of transparency in trial and undue preferential treatment to lead suspect, Rahman Adedoyin. In a statement issued by the CPA's Executive Director, Olufemi Lawson, and obtained by SaharaReporters, the group said the alleged murder was perpetrated in Osun State and should be tried there. "Having followed the series of claims and counterclaims from persons directly or indirectly linked to the circumstances that led to the death of Timothy, we are constrained, to demand, that the prosecution of these suspect, be made to be transparent as much as possible, especially as we have begun to observe, unpleasant scenarios around the handling of the suspects, in Abuja where they are currently being held.

This must be an avenue for us as a nation, to prove our mettle as a society of justice, no matter whose ox is gored.
