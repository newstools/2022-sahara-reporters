The incident was made public by a non-governmental organization, Doctors Without Borders, which received several of the casualties at a local hospitalThe strike was later confirmed by Chaibou Aboubacar, governor of the Maradi region. According to Aboubacar, the strike occurred on February 18, 2022 in the village of Nachade and four of the children died instantly while three others died on their way to the hospital.Major General Jimmy Akpor, Nigeria's Director of Defence Information said an investigation into the incident had begun.“As a matter of policy, the Nigerian Air Force does not make any incursions into areas outside Nigeria's territorial boundaries. That's our policy,"Reacting in a statement by Benson Olugbuo, CIVIC’s Country Director, the group called for transparency in the investigation as it expressed concerns over reports of the killing.It also urged the Nigerian government to work closely with the Nigerien authorities.He said, "If civilian casualties from the airstrike are confirmed, the Government of Nigeria should provide post-harm amends to civilians affected by the strike and put in place measures to prevent the recurrence.”“This airstrike shows yet again that it is civilians who bear the brunt of conflict in the region. Governments carrying out military operations, including airstrikes, must take tangible and stronger steps to prevent harm to the civilian population,” he added.“We welcome the launch of an investigation by Nigeria’s military, and we encourage the investigation to be prompt and transparent. We also encourage the Government of Nigeria to continue to work to improve its efforts to minimize harm to civilians from airstrikes,” Olugbuo further said.The Center also urged the Government of Nigeria to continue improving its air-ground coordination to prevent and mitigate harm to civilians during airstrikes.Niger and Nigeria have been conducting joint military operations against armed gangs responsible for a wave of kidnappings and killings in the region.The Maradi region in Niger is one of the most affected by the violence created by bandits in neighbouring Nigerian states, Katsina, Sokoto, and Zamfara.
