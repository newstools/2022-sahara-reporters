The disgraced police chief, Abba Kyari, violated the law and code of conduct for law enforcement officers, a police report submitted to the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, (SAN), stated. According to the report, Kyari violated the law and the code of law enforcement officers considering his dealings with internet fraudster, Ramon Olarewaju aka Hushpuppi, adding that a total of N279.120m flowed into Kyari’s younger brother’s bank account at various times.  Meanwhile, the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), on Monday, declared the suspended commander of the Intelligence Response Team (IRT) wanted for selling cocaine consignment seized by IRT operatives from drug barons at the Enugu airport in January this year. According to the Chairman/Chief Executive of the NDLEA, Brig. Gen Buba Marwa (retd), the arrest of Kyari, was a clear message that no one would be spared in the agency’s ongoing war against illicit drug business. However, the police report frowned on Kyari’s conduct in “hobnobbing with suspected fraudsters and people of questionable means in his capacity as a senior police officer and the head of the IRT. “He had also violated the provisions of the Social Media Policy (SMP) for the Nigeria Police Force by responding to the FBI’s indictment on his Facebook page without recourse to laid down procedure and also by his admission of broadcasting pictures and video clips to his contacts on social media.
