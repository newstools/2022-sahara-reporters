A former senator representing Bayelsa East Senatorial District, Ben Murray-Bruce, has announced the death of his mother, Madam Margaret Murray Bruce, paying tribute to her. Murray-Bruce made the announcement on Twitter on Tuesday, saying his mother died at 4.40 am earlier in the day.  Born on October 26, 1926, the late Murray-Bruce would have turned 96 this year. He said, “Life. Indeed, like sand in the wind, today it’s here, tomorrow it's gone. My mum is gone. She died at 4:40 am this morning. My gem of inestimable value, my support system, my best friend, my everything—she’s gone. “My consolation is that in her lifetime, I gave her not just everything that money could buy, but most importantly, I gave her my presence, my time, my everything. “On uncountable occasions, I will go to her house to hug her and play with her for no reason but love, the kind that only sons share with their mums. I love you, mum, and I miss you. This one hurts so bad. Forever yours.” In an interview with THISDAY in October 2021, the late said she was not afraid of death. “I am not afraid of death. I know it can come anytime, any day. I am very religious and I have lived well with my Maker. And if it comes today, I know I am going straight to heaven,” she said.
