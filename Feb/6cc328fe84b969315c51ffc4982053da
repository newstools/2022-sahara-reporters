The Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, says he is looking for the Academic Staff Union of Nigeria (ASUU) for declaring a one-month warning strike at a time the Federal Government is attending to their demands.The university lecturers had on Monday embarked on a strike action to press their demands, which they claimed the Nigerian government has been reluctant to meet. Speaking on Wednesday while briefing journalists after the federal executive council (FEC) meeting presided over by Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, the minister said it was not the government’s fault if there had been no agreement after several negotiations between both parties.Adamu said ASUU’s decision to embark on strike came abruptly amidst ongoing negotiations.“ASUU, unfortunately, they have gone on strike and I am looking for them because all the issues are being addressed,” he said.“The last thing that happened was that our committee looked at their demands but there are renegotiations going on. They submitted a draft agreement which the ministry is looking at.“A committee is looking at it. Immediately it finishes, the government is meant to announce what it had accepted. Then suddenly, I heard them going on strike.”On allegations from ASUU about his absence from meetings, he said, “ASUU will never say that. I always call the meeting myself. The meetings I didn’t attend were those that happened when I was in hospital in Germany.“We want a peaceful resolution. The federal government is ready to meet them on all issues they have raised and if there are so many meetings and the gap is not closing, then I think it’s not the fault of the government.“There is a solution to this. The negotiations are the solution and that is why I have said that I am surprised that ASUU has gone on strike.”
