The Oyo State Government and the Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company (IBEDC) have come to a resolution following a misunderstanding that led to the closure of the company's offices on Wednesday.This was contained in a statement issued jointly by Temilolu Ashamu, the state Commissioner for Energy and Mineral Resources and John Ayodele, the Chief Operating Officer, IBEDC. Recall that on Wednesday, the company had kicked against the closure of its offices describing it as retaliatory alleging that the action was borne out of the government's huge indebtedness to the company.However, on Thursday, during a meeting between the two parties, after a meeting at the Government Secretariat, Agodi, they vowed to continue to work together in the interest of the residents of the state.They assured members of the public of the restoration of electricity as soon as possible, adding that the two parties would continue an amicable resolution of the issue and work together to make electricity meters available to all residents of the state.The statement reads in part: “This is to notify the general public that the Oyo State Government and the IBEDC have resolved and agreed to work together in the interest of the public.“The general public is hereby assured of the restoration of electricity supply as soon as possible, while the two parties shall continue amicable resolution of the issue in the interest of the public, including working together to make electricity meters available to residents of the state.”
