He was opening the gate for Daniel’s driver when he was knocked down by the vehicle. The Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed the incident. He however said that it was an accident. “That was an accident. He was opening the gate, the gate bounced back and the driver mistakenly hit him with the gate. It’s an accident, it can happen to anybody,” he said.
