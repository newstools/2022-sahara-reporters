We feel they just did that to make it look like an attack. “We have been facing various security breaches in the community informed by the vast ungoverned land taken over by the Nigerian Air Force (NAF). You know we were in court, we won at the high court but they appealed the case at the Appeal Court here in Kaduna.” He called on the state government to mediate between the community and the NAF over the vast land which he said is a hiding place for criminals. The Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Muhammad Jalige, is yet to respond to calls put across to him at the time of this report. Barakallahu community is about five kilometres away from Kaduna main city, along the Kaduna-Zaria Road.
