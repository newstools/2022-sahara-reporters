The National Executive Council (NEC) of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has voted to embark on a one-month warning strike to press home their demands from the government. The Council had a meeting in Lagos that dragged into the early hours of Monday, Vanguard reports.  A source told the newspaper that the warning strike is to allow the Nigerian Government to do the needful failure to which the union would go on an indefinite strike. "We just want to give the government a long rope hoping that it would see the need to avoid a total paralysis of academic activities in the nation’s universities. We are parents too and have our children in the system but we cannot watch and allow the total collapse of education in the country. “Our agitation is in the interest of all and if the system is made better, we will all enjoy it. Prominent personalities in the country have waded into the matter but the government seems recalcitrant. Our National President would explain more when he briefs the press later today,” the source was quoted as saying. The demands of the union include the payment of Earned Academic Allowance, revitalisation fund, the replacement of the Integrated Personnel Payroll Information System (IPPIS), with the University Transparency and Accountability System (UTAS).
