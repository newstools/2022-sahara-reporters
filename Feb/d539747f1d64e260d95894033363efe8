A notorious arms dealer who supplies arms to bandit leader, Bello Turji, has been arrested by operatives of the Nigeria police.  Also, 36 gunmen from across Sokoto State with links to Turji were also arrested, the police said on Tuesday.  This was disclosed by the Assistant Inspector General of Police for Sokoto, Kebbi and Zamfara, AIG Ahmed Zaki Gwandu, who further said camps linked to Turji were discovered by special forces.  Operatives of Operation Sahara Storm carried out the raid in three locations of Rabah, Goronyo and Illela.  Gwandu said among those arrested was 33-year-old supplier of arms to Bello Turji, Musa Mohammed Kamarawa.  Karamawa confessed to possessing firearms and that before his arrest, he was planning to send Bello Turji a truck loaded with rifles worth at least N28 million.   Gwandu also disclosed the items recovered by the authorities as including 1,412 rounds of ammunition, four pistols, three armoured personnel carriers, four vehicles, drugs, 16 mobile phones and 150 cows. Others include grenades and one rocket launcher. Similarly, the spokesperson for the Sokoto State Police Command, ASP Sanusi Abubakar, said the success was due to the co-operation between the various departments of the security agencies. "The brave policemen represented by AIG Ahmad Zaki Gwandu and our other staff members have been sent to Sokoto due to the escalating terrorist crisis.  "And in eight days, there were a lot of places that were hideouts for the militants," he said.
