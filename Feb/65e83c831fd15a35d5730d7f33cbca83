Former Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II, on Monday, says Nigeria “is living on extra time,” while declaring that the country would be facing deeper challenges from 2023.He disclosed at a reception marking the 80th birthday of Babanla Adinni of Egbaland, Chief Tayo Sowunmi, in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. The former Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) governor and leader of the Khalifa of Tijaniyya sect in Nigeria, also warned Presidential aspirants to be prepared for the onerous task of the country.Sanusi, however, denied eyeing the presidency seat in 2023, saying he was content being the spiritual leader of the Tijaniyyah.Sanusi said, “To be honest, we are living on extra time. In 2015, we were in a deep hole. In 2023, we will be in an even much deeper hole than in 2015.“Those struggling to be President, I hope they understand that the problems that they are going to face are multiples of the problems that were faced in 2015. All of us have to be ready for difficult decisions and if they are taken, we are all going to pay for them.“But the solution is not for all of us to jump into politics. This country needs good politicians. It needs imams, pastors and bishops who are going to stand up and remind them (politicians) of the fear of God. It needs technocrats who are going to critique their policies.“It needs traditional rulers who are going to speak as the conscience of the people. Everyone has a role to play and we should try to play that role to the best of our ability.”
