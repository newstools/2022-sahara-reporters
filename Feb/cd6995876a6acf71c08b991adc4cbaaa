The family and lawyers of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra have now been cleared to see the pro-Biafra agitator. Kanu’s brother, Prince Kanu Meme, in a Facebook post on Monday, said, “The visiting team of is now cleared to see Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, at the department of state security services Abuja.”  Kanu’s family and his team of lawyers had raised fresh concerns over his safety, claiming that Nigeria’s secret police, Department of State Services (DSS), had been denying them access to him.  Binta Nyako, a judge of the Federal High Court in Abuja had said Kanu should be allowed to meet his lawyers and family members twice a week – Mondays and Thursdays.  However, Kanu’s younger brother, Prince Emmanuel Kanu last Monday said he was at the Abuja headquarters of the DSS where the IPOB leader is currently detained but was not allowed to see him.  Prince who said he was also at the secret police headquarters the previous week to see his brother as directed by the court but denied access to him, expressed worry over the reason behind the action of the DSS.  “I have Been denied access to see Mazi Nnamdi Kanu (IPOB Leader) on two separate occasions at the Department Of State Security Services Abuja,” Prince had posted on Facebook.  “As Lawless as the DSS is, it goes to show that Mazi Nnamdi Kanu's life is in grave danger. It remains the order of the court that Mazi Nnamdi Kanu (IPOB Leader) must be seen twice weekly, Mondays and Thursdays.  “Why can't I see him? Has he been killed or poisoned? There must be proof of Life. We demand proof of life.”
