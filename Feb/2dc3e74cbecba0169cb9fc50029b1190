The Chief Judge of Oyo State, Justice Munta Abimbola, has nullified the elevation of Baales and Mogajis (eminent chiefs) in Ibadan land in its judgement on Thursday. The judge asked the traditional rulers to return to their original positions before the setting up of the Justice Boade Commission of Inquiry.  Also, an order of Perpetual Injunction was issued restraining them from the status of elevation or wearing crowns or coronets. Justice Abimbola in his judgment said he found no merit in their application before the court and dismissed it in its entirety. He further held that all government’s actions must comply with the law of the land. There was a crisis regarding the monarchy structure in Ibadan involving the late Olubadan of Ibadan land, Saliu Adetunji, the current one who was formerly the Otun Olubadan, Lekan Balogun and Balogun of Ibadan land, Owolabi Olakulehin The crisis reached its peak in August 2017 when a former governor of the state, Abiola Ajimobi, presented staff of office to about 21 chiefs who were promoted to the status of kings. The crisis was, however, laid to rest in November 2019 when the incumbent, Seyi Makinde, withdrew the crowns of the officials as part of the condition to settle out of court.
