Some Nigerians on the microblogging platform, Twitter have accused the family of Ramon Adedoyin, the owner of the Hilton Hotel in Ile-Ife, Osun State, of paying some “influencers” to trend #Adedoyincase.Adedoyin is being detained in connection with the death of Timothy Adegoke, a postgraduate student of OAU who lodged in Hilton Hotels and Resorts at Ile-Ife but was killed there. Adegoke reportedly lodged in the hotel upon his arrival from Abuja on November 5 to enable him to arrive early for his examination at the OAU Distance Learning Centre, Moro, Osun State, on November 6 and November 7, 2021.He was, however, found dead in the hotel room where he lodged, which belongs to Rahman Adedoyin.There had been rumours in some quarters that it was a case of ritual killings but the Adedoyin family denied the claims.In December 2021, they had urged Nigerians on social media to stop smearing the hotelier’s name, insisting that Adedoyin was not a ritualist and had no hand in Adegoke’s death.However, two months after this, some selected social media accounts have made screenshots of the family's claim and reshared such with the same hashtag, in a bid to seek public acceptance for Adedoyin, the accused person.SaharaReporters observed that some selected Twitter accounts had started trending the hashtag while urging others to do the same with their bank account details which they promised to credit.The handles include @princelybrown, @officialpelu, @Saddiq_Mb, @cutebabe425, @itorobong_, @theonlyologi among others.Meanwhile, some Twitter users have lambasted them, alleging that they must have been paid to do such.Below are some of the reactions of Twitter users:https://twitter.com/An_Najimy001/status/1492155114701873154?t=luNbFFQUDiwdGYnnosnJsg&s=19https://twitter.com/IbrahimKazeem_M/status/1492147095545036803?t=hM5jqfrwr30afogu_ZRqLQ&s=19https://twitter.com/smilesundai/status/1492143902287179781?t=hRbARsWZTgjk3UVQgjm3Kw&s=19https://twitter.com/Nigeriangod_/status/1492142107003342850?t=amy8tYSrysdzK4sfRmj5sA&s=19https://twitter.com/Sir_Aj3/status/1492140714125373449?t=j-_1q_QSI1koAs7oZXyzug&s=19https://twitter.com/De_Catalyste/status/1492132512797274116?t=gAyVFqYYGnEBsGzXVLC38g&s=19https://twitter.com/popular_lonerrr/status/1492131417538629636?t=DZOvReXjosicTvnT8FOmIg&s=19https://twitter.com/Agbeti/status/1492127423470657536?t=o1WDvzEDcU9Aq0mA50ba0w&s=19
