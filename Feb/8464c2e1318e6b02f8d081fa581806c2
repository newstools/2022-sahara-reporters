Aloy Ejimakor, Special counsel for Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, on Monday, kicked against the refusal of operatives the Department of State Services to grant him access to his client.  Ejimakor, in a post on his Twitter handle on Monday, said the DSS barred lawyers to the detained IPOB leader from meeting Kanu last Thursday and today, Monday.  The lawyer noted that the act by the DSS was in contravention of the order of Justice Binta Nyako of a Federal High Court in Abuja, who said Kanu should be allowed to meet his lawyers twice a week – Mondays and Thursdays.  Ejimakor said, “Last Thursday, we were not allowed visitation with Onyendu because, according to DSS, the ‘special squad’ in charge of visitations went on ‘outside assignment’. They asked us to come on Monday (today).  “Today, we‘re at DSS. They’re telling us the same thing. We disagree.”  ALERT: Last Thursday, we were not allowed visitation with Onyendu because, according to DSS, the âspecial squadâ incharge of visitations went on âoutside assignmentâ. They asked us to come on Monday (today).Today, weâre at DSS. Theyâre telling us the same thing. We DISAGREE.  Last year, the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, had announced that Kanu “was intercepted through the collaborative efforts of Nigerian intelligence and Security Services” and consequently extradited to Nigeria.  The IPOB leader has been in DSS custody since his arrest and extradition and is currently on trial for a treasonable felony.  Subsequently, a 15-count terrorism charge was slammed on Nnamdi Kanu by the Nigerian Government.  He, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges and asked the court to discharge and acquit him without standing trial, saying the charges were incurably defective and not worth being defended.  Kanu was in court on Wednesday, February 16 but the court adjourned till April 8 for ruling on whether or not to quash the charges.
