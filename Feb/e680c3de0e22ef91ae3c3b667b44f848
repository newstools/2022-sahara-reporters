Some former students of the University of Jos, Plateau State have paid a visit to their former classmate, Minabelem Hillary who became mentally ill on the eve of his master’s project defence.  The kind-hearted alumni were said to have traced the location of their colleague to Bakana in Rivers State after which they ensured his admission at a Psychiatric Hospital in Rumuigbo, Port Harcourt, with the payment of N320, 000.  A doctor at the facility identified simply as Mr. Hillary was quoted as saying the young man stands a good chance of complete recovery.  A tweet from one Abatam Nwosu (@Abatam01) who shared the news and video on social media, reads: “The Alumni of the University of Jos, Nigeria, drew tears from the eyes of many in Bakana, Rivers State as they left the comfort of their homes in Abuja to come celebrate Valentine with their former classmate, Mr. Minabelem Hilary, who became mentally unstable on the eve of his master’s degree defence.  “The Alumni traced him across the river to Bakana and after spending time with him, took him to the Psychiatric Hospital in Rumuigbo, Port Harcourt, and paid for his treatment and admission to a private ward with the sum of N320, 000 (three hundred and twenty thousand naira) only.  “The golden-hearted former classmates hugged him, bought him new clothes and laughed with him as they exchanged some old school jokes.  “Reacting to the kind gesture, a doctor at the facility said Mr. Hillary had a good chance of complete recovery, especially if he took his drugs faithfully.”  https://twitter.com/Abatam01/status/1493851953809473542?t=fkl3gllSpYA_7JlgNZAshQ&s=19
