The Adamawa State Police Command after denying receipt of the complaint of threats by a South-Easterner, Vincent Umeh, has backtracked and commenced investigation into the matter.The police are investigating the alleged threats by a Lagos-based Deputy Commissioner of Police, Ibrahim Babazango. Babazango, an indigene of Adamawa, had allegedly threatened violent attacks against Umeh, who hailed from Anambra State, for purchasing a house next to his own in Yola, the state capital.In a viral audio, Babazango was heard warning Umeh to reverse the transaction, because he would not take a southerner as his next door neighbor.On Thursday, the police, in a statement, had denied that Umeh had petitioned the command on the matter.The statement which SaharaReporters reported on Thursday read, “The Adamawa State Police Command has denied receiving any complaint against Deputy Commissioner of police, Ibrahim Babazango, who allegedly threatened a Southeasterner for acquiring a house next to his own in the state.”However, in a dramatic twist, the police on Friday, announced that the command had commenced investigation into the complaint against the senior cop, who is currently attached to the Lagos command.Spokesperson for the command, DSP Suleiman Nguroje said, “The Commissioner of police CP Mohammed Ahmed Barde, has ordered investigations into the allegation."An online publication with a captioned; “Police officer gives violence threats to a buyer of property Near His Adamawa House in which the life of one Vincent Umeh 'M', was reported to have been threatened by a senior police officer to be investigated."The CP has directed the Deputy Commissioner of Police in-charge of Criminal Investigation Department to investigate and  ascertain the veracity of this allegations for further necessary action.”Meanwhile, the police deputy commissioner dragged Umeh to a court of law, challenging his right to purchase the property. Accordingly, SaharaReporters gathered that the lawsuit is aimed at invoking Sharia law which states that anyone intending to dispose of his landed property must first advertise same to his immediate neighbour.
