A first-year female student of Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba, Ondo State, is currently in the hospital after being brutally assaulted by her landlord and his wife for bringing her boyfriend to her apartment in the Obasanjo Small Gate area of Ondo State.The assault, which took place on the night of February 23, saw the landlord and his wife raining blows on the female student named Bolaji, leaving her with deep cuts on her neck and other parts of her body. SaharaReporters gathered that Bolaji's parents had pleaded with the landlord to help keep an eye on her as she was a “small” girl, who needed some monitoring.However, in carrying out that directive, the couple went overboard by brutally assaulting the young lady and leaving her to land on the hospital bed.Aggrieved students of AAUA, who got wind of the attack on Bolaji, stormed the compound almost immediately to take a pound of flesh on the landlord and his wife.But the swift intervention of policemen at a station nearby averted what could have been a major crisis in the area."The landlord and his wife beat the female student for bringing her boyfriend to her rented apartment."Her parents assigned the landlord to help monitor her movement because she is young and so on that fateful day when the guy that came to visit her at home left, the landlord and his wife bounced on her and injured her."It was even the university's ambulance that came that midnight after receiving a call from the Students Union Government Welfare Director to carry her to school's health centre because she couldn't walk after the assault on her."Other students in that area almost beat the landlord and his wife but the police arrived the scene on time to rescue them," a neighbour of the victim told SaharaReporters.Condemning the attack on Bolaji, Welfare Director of the university's students union, Odole Mojisola, said that they would pursue the matter to ensure justice prevailed.“I received news of one of our beloved students being brutally assaulted by her landlord. I had to alert the ambulance before the girl was conveyed to the university's health center as she was seriously wounded."The assaulter is currently in police custody. He was apprehended immediately by the police for further investigation. We will never condone any inhumane act against the student as the welfare of students is our utmost priority," she said.
