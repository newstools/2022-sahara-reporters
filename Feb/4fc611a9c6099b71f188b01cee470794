Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has assured ‘repentant’ Boko Haram terrorists that the Nigerian government will take care of them. Osinbajo told them they will be supported to have a legitimate means of income. Yemi Osinbajo The Vice President said this at the Hajj Camp in Maiduguri on Thursday during his working visit to Borno to launch the MSME Clinic and inaugurate various projects executed by the state government. It was learnt that the ‘repentant’ terrorists gave Osinbajo a rousing welcome, according to Daily Trust. “I am the chairman of the Presidential Committee and His Excellency, Governor Umara Zulum, is the vice-chairman of the committee. “We will be working with you and the state government and other donor agencies and friends to ensure that we are able to provide you with a means of not just income but a place where you can settle down with your families and do your own work and do your own business. “But you must work patiently with us. God bless you, God bless you and you will be well. We will make sure that we take care of you the best way we can by God's grace,” he said. Similarly, earlier at the palace of the Shehu of Borno, Governor, Zulum appealed to the Nigerian government to support the state government’s efforts to resettle Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) back to their ancestral homes. He also emphasised the need for proper handling of the surrendered insurgents, saying “if we manage defectors of Boko Haram very well, the insurgency will come to an end very soon.” “We have about 66,000 indigenes that are living in the Republic of Cameroon, 120,000 people in the Republic of Niger and about 25,000 living in the Republic of Chad. This is enough figure the state government alone cannot shoulder the responsibilities, and our people are yearning to come back home,” the governor said.
