President Muhammadu Buhari will in a matter of hours sign the re-worked Electoral Act Amendment Bill. The Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr Femi Adesina, disclosed this on Tuesday during an interview on Channels Television.  “He (Buhari) will sign it (the bill) any moment from now,” he said while appearing as a guest on a programme. “It could be today, it could be tomorrow, it could be anytime, but within the 30 days. “It could be signed today; it could be signed tomorrow. In a matter of hours; not days. Hours could be 24 hours; it could be 48 hours; not days, not weeks.” There has been condemnation from several quarters over the Buhari presidency’s reluctance to sign the bill. SaharaReporters on Monday reported that the African Action Congress (AAC) would join protests to press home the demand for the signing. This had been contained in a statement issued on Monday by Femi Adeyeye, the National Publicity Secretary of the Party. According to the statement, the protests are necessary considering the abuse the electoral space had suffered under President Muhammadu Buhari administration.
