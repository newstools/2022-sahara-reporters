 Tiger Eye Foundation, a non-profit organisation, has called on Nigerian journalists to apply for its 2022 edition of Nigeria Investigates programme. In a statement sent to SaharaReporters on Friday, the organisation said the initiative is aimed at helping people to hold the government accountable.  "Societies thrive when the powerful are held accountable. When the truth is unmasked and information made accessible to all. And investigative journalism is one of the most effective tools for such accountability, especially in democracies like Nigeria," the statement read. "There is an urgent need for more investigative journalists who are ethical, fearless, and skilled at unearthing stories to challenge and correct the status quo. This is where you come in. Tiger Eye Foundation seeks applicants to the 2022 edition of its Nigeria Investigates programme, training for early to mid-level investigative journalists." It explained that each applicant is expected to submit a pitch detailing their potential story idea, adding that selected candidates would thereafter undergo a five-day training. "Applicants submit story pitches, with successful participants moving to the five-day training. There, they are taken through a rigorous exercise on investigative techniques, high risk and hostile environment compliance, storytelling, and post-production," it added. "One of the short term goals of this training is shaping the original pitch sent in by each successful applicant. At the end of the training, participants are provided resources to produce one story based on this updated pitch. " "Apply here https://forms.gle/DCq2TE5D7qfTB3kW9 before February 16. Decisions will be communicated by February 27."
