Bandits otherwise known as terrorists have demanded N500million after abducting the wives and daughters of Malam Ibrahim Tanko, the Sarkin Hausawa of Anguwar Azara in Jere along the Abuja-Kaduna highway in Kaduna State. Bandits last Wednesday raided the residence of Malm Tanko and abducted his two wives and four daughters, but one of the wives was released after the bandits realised she was suffering from high blood pressure.  Malam Tanko, who disclosed the new development said the kidnappers called one of his aides on Saturday and demanded the ransom, according to Daily Trust. “I told the kidnappers I had no such money. One of them said I should go and source for it,” he lamented.
