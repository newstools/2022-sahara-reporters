Council elections in the Federal Capital Territory on Saturday witnessed low turnout of voters and failure of Bimodal Voter Accreditation System in many areas in the city. There were also cases of late arrival of officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission and voting materials to polling units. File photo used to illustrate story. The election took place in the six area councils of the FCT including Kwali, Bwari, Kuje, Gwagwalada and Abuja Municipal Area Council. There were cases of failure of BVAS in many areas such as Kubwa, Gwagwalada, Abaji, thereby making accreditation and voting difficult and slow. Some of the officials, who spoke with SaharaReporters, blamed the hitch on poor network. Recall that INEC chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, on Thursday announced that it had deployed 2,822 Biometric Voters Accreditation System for the Federal Capital Territory council elections. He noted that 1,373,492 registered voters were expected to participate in the elections for chairmen and councillors in 2,229 polling units.
