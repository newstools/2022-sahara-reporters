Residents of Tashar Biri Village in Yatumaki of Dan Musa Local Government Area have been asked by bandits to pay N30 million or risk ferocious attacks. The request followed the killing of a bandit kingpin known as Dankarami (Small).  Airstrikes executed recently by the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) aircraft in Katsina State killed Dankarami. The deceased was born in a settlement called Lambar Gabas in Rukudawa district in the Zurmi Local Government Area, where he owned a mansion with more than 38 rooms, a mosque and an Islamiyya school. Dankarami is also known as Gwaska. His settlement, Lambar Gabas, is situated not more than two kilometres east of Rukudawa, a farming community that has suffered a series of deadly assaults by armed bandits for more than a decade. His foot soldiers are notoriously known as “Yan Shabakwai” or the “teenagers” because they are mostly young and are responsible for most of the abductions, cattle rustling and deadly raids on dozens of communities. It was gathered that he met his waterloo when he visited one Sabira, a teenage girl he had forcibly married in Tashar Biri village. Following his death, his boys demanded that the community must provide Sabira and her mother and pay N30 million, or risk being attacked. Also, in the absence of Sabira, the terrorists were said to have abducted her grandmother and one Aliyu, identified as her son. Most residents have fled the village after they got a hint that the leader of the bandits, one Mai Lore, would raid the community and kill everyone.
