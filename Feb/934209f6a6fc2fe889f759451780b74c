The technical glitch that paralysed operations of banks, telecom operators, immigration and other critical agencies of government has continued to affect business operations across the sectors, 10 days into the battle by experts to restore the collapsed national data infrastructure,According to Vanguard, most of the telecom subscribers were unable to retrieve their lost SIM cards or get new ones due to the non-accessibility of the National Identity Management Commission, NIMC portal. Also, some bank customers complained of the inability of their various banks to link their Biometric Verification Number, BVN with their National Identity Numbers, NINs.Recall that the breakdown of the backbone infrastructure occurred 10 days ago, which affected most government agencies like immigration, the police, road safety and telecom operators among other critical public institutions.This development had sparked off reactions from industry experts, who feared that the continued breakdown of the Central Server could lead to huge loss to the economy and compromise of the nation’s security.They warned the government to do everything possible to restore normalcy and services in the system.The President of the Association of Telecommunications Companies of Nigeria, ATCON, Mr. Ikechukwu Nnamani, when contacted said, the most important thing is to ensure the restoration of the portal without further delay.Nnamani, who said he did not have credible data to quantify the loss so far caused by the system breakdown, said, “Since NIMC offered an alternative platform for NIN verification, I will encourage people to make use of the alternative platform provided by NIMC to avoid further disruption of services.”
