The founder of Living Faith Church, Bishop David Oyedepo, on Sunday, said anyone who sacrifices human beings to stay in power will perish. The bishop made this known during the first service at Faith Tabernacle, noting that some people were nervous because they didn’t know what he was going to say next.  “All those agents of the devil, they are jittery now. But every kidnapper that woke up this morning won’t wake up tomorrow morning. “Anyone shedding any innocent blood, wherever they may be hiding in this country, judgement locates them today. Anyone sacrificing human beings to remain in office is cut down today. “I think they have heard what they are waiting for. When the Holy Ghost moves on me, that is what happens. There will be calamity tomorrow morning,” he said. The preacher had in January said God could pick Nigeria’s next president from his church. Oyedepo also said God could pick a female president from the church."And it is important for me to mention to members of the church because another time is here now. You better ask counsel of the priest before you torment your life by yourself. “What office will you win election to that I will now need you? No. My eternal helper is up there, and they know if I have ever asked a thing of anyone. Allow God to lead you. Don’t let greed and avarice lead you. “Don’t get me wrong, God can pick a president from this church. That President could even be a female,” he had said.
