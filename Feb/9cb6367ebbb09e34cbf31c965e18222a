Several Islamic State’s West Africa Province militants fleeing airstrikes of the Nigerian military have drowned around the Marte axis of Lake Chad, a known stronghold of the terrorists in Borno State.According to a report by PR Nigeria, no fewer than 25 of the terrorists met their waterloo. Military fighter jets of the Nigerian Air Force, the report said, raided camps of the Islamic State of West African Province in a weeklong sustained aerial attack leading to the death of scores of the terrorists.An intelligence operative told the news medium that camps and warehouses serving as ISWAP insurgents’ ammunition and firearms stores were bombed and destroyed by the aircraft.“The military jets’ bombardments were simultaneously carried out at Bukar Mairam and Jubularam, Abbaganaram and Chikul Gudu which resulted in the explosion of the warehouses, killing several terrorists.“The terrorists who survived the blast at Bukar Mairam and Jubularam fled and attempted to cross a river within the Lake Chad axis. It was in the process that about 25 of them got drowned,” the source added.He further said recent air offensives by troops have seriously affected ISWAP operational command, thwarting the group’s plans to carry out major attacks on military formations in the North-East.
