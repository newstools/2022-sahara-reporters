Operatives of the Ogun Police Command have arrested a man, Kehinde Oladimeji, and his wife, Adejumoke Raji, over alleged possession of fresh human parts. The suspects were arrested following a report lodged at Kemta Divisional Headquarters by one Chief Moshood Ogunwolu, the Baale of Leme community.  Ogunwolu told the police that a certain Pastor Adisa Olarewaju, who is a co-tenant with the suspects, informed him that offensive odour was coming out of the suspects' room. Spokesperson for the police in the state, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said following the information, the DPO Kemta Division, Adeniyi Adekunle, quickly led his detectives to the scene where the search was conducted. Oyeyemi said, “On searching the room, a plastic bowl containing fresh different parts of human being was discovered in the room and the couple was promptly arrested.” He said the suspects confessed that they were herbalists and that the human parts comprising hands, breasts and others were given to them by one Michael, who they claimed resided in the Adatan area of Abeokuta. Oyeyemi disclosed that efforts to locate the said Michael had so far proved abortive as the suspects don’t know his abode.
