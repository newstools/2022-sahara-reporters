The police have arrested Alhaji Shehu Audu, chairmanship candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress for Daura Local Government Area in the forthcoming council poll in Katsina State. President Muhammadu Buhari is from Daura.  The Chairman of the association of former councillors in the state, Alhaji Ibrahim Suleiman, disclosed this in Katsina on Wednesday. According to Suleiman, Audu was framed up to deny him from being the party’s candidate in the forthcoming election for an unpopular candidate. He accused the State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Ahmad El Marzuq of masterminding the arrest to pave the way for his candidate whom he said was rejected by the majority of the voters in Daura APC. Suleiman said, “Alhaji Shehu Audu is currently being detained at the state CID (Criminal Investigation Department) office for allegedly collecting money from some youths in the area to secure jobs for them. “I am here to inform you that he was framed up.” The leader of former councillors in the state added that Audu who is currently detained at the state’s CID, “needs medical attention”. Meanwhile, Suleiman has sent an appeal to the Katsina Governor, Aminu Bello Masari, asking him to intervene in the matter to save the party from being defeated in April local council poll. He said “it is unfortunate that this is happening in the home of President Muhammadu Buhari. That is why we are appealing to party leaders, especially the Governor to intervene in the issue to avoid it from degenerating further”.
