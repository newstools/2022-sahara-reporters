Funmilayo Adebayo, controversial Nigerian evangelist nicknamed Mummy G.O, has said any member of her church that auditions for a reality TV show, Big Brother Naija, will die.  Mummy G.O’s ministry, Rapture Proclaimer Evangelistic Church, became popular and controversial in December 2021 when she began preaching about things that could make people go to hell fire.  In one of her preachings, she revealed that shas an executive/super agent of the highest form of darkness with Lucifer and had sold guns, pushed cocaine with fly-carpet not normal transport before she was arrested by Jesus Christ.  She mentioned that her beauty and sexy body shape were taken away from her when she became a born again Christian.  Mummy G.O, who started her ministry 24 years ago, claimed she was born in Egypt where she joined the military but died during a war and was initiated afterward.  From there, she claimed to have learnt how to speak fluently and other experiences as she stopped schooling at primary 4.  According to her, God called her to preach to people of the world to focus on heaven but people hated her because she says secrets about things people don’t like to hear that will make them miss heaven.  In one of her recent videos, she described Big Brother Naija show as demonic, adding that any child of God who watches the show will die.  “Any member of this church mistakenly or stupidly tries it, I will tell God to kill him on that stage. From there he must go to mortuary. He wouldn't come back. He will die. I wouldn't even pray for repentance. It's death because if he comes back, another person will try it. Unless if Ananias and Sapphira did not die. If those ones died, then God must kill the person,” she said.
