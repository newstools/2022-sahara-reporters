Some Nigerians have accused Revolution Plus, a real estate company of fraud.  The customers who took to social media accused the company of failing to allocate properties to them after they made full payments.  However, in a statement on its Instagram page on Wednesday, the company dismissed the allegations, adding that the firm “was built on integrity and trust.”  The company also said it was reviewing the complaints from its customers. It assured that all its customers would be attended to in due course, adding that allocations are usually done in batches.  “We wish to state that as it is with every business entity, there will always be a few dissatisfied customers but we wish to make some clarifications on the series of complaints and allegations leveled against us as this will enable us resolve all underlying issues,” it read.  “As a result of the high volume of subscribers who subscribe to our estates, allocations are often done in batches and often times we may exceed the time frame given for allocation.”  Below are some of the allegations against the company;   Myself and my husband bought 1 Acre from RevolutionPlus Proprty since 2019, allocation dem neva do. They ignore all msgs on their post @Gistloversblog1 One truth I know about #revolutionplus is you will NEVER get physical allocation unless you pay for survey (300k) They will never tell you this when you go for inspection.Awon wÃ©rÃ¨   Itâs not false allegations Iâm a victim   Revolution Plus properties get as he be....
