Nigerians in United Arab Emirates who have been denied work permits are now being subjected to hardship.Some of the victims told SaharaReporters that at least 500 Nigerians are frustrated, stranded and are sleeping at the metro stations over their inability to pay their rents. SaharaReporters was told that Emirate authorities were only renewing work permits for Nigerians whose job categories fall under skill levels 1 and 2 – those who hold managerial positions or have specific technical/professional education and training.The implication is that those who have skills levels 3, 4, 5 – whose jobs do not demand specific educational or professional training are deemed expendable and their work permits are not being renewed.“Most Nigerians are in this category,” a victim revealed.However, the source lamented that the Nigerian ambassador had not made any move to solve the issue.He asserted that the issue of cultism which happened last year, where some Nigerians killed one another as well as street robberies involving Nigerians were partly responsible for the ordeal.The source said the embassy had not given any favourable response, noting that they initially declined to speak on the issue until some groups of Nigerians protested at the embassy.He said, "The issue here is that UAE has stopped giving labour cards to skill levels 4 and 5 of which most Nigerians are in this category; they only renew labour cards to skill levels 1 and 2 which include for example managers or rather professionals like doctors."Some of us lost our jobs because we can’t work without visa as most companies are afraid of fine from the ministry of labour. Per each illegal employee, the UAE fine is 50,000 dirhams which is more than N7million."Our monthly rent is between 400 to 600 dirhams per month, which is about N80,000. I called the ministry of labour and we discussed; they also inform me that it was still blocked and renewal was not possible."The Nigeria ambassador hasn’t even made any move to address this issue. Daily, people are losing their jobs; more than 500 Nigerians now sleep at the metro station. The ambassador of UAE to Nigeria earlier denied this news; but the video can be found on the instagram page of NIDCOM."What happens has been officially stated by the authorities of UAE, but we who are here know the reality. It’s terrible from June 2021 till now; the embassy has not given any favourable response. Initially they declined to speak on the issue till some group protested at the embassy and they said they are working to resolve it."But the major issue is a Dubai national was killed By a Nigerian, and they have high regard for their citizens which is the foundation of our problem here.”
