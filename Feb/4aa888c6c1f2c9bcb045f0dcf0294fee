The family of Ladan Ibrahim, a civil servant in Sokoto State, who was arrested for alleged terrorism financing has lamented the delay in the investigation of the case.According to them, Ibrahim was arrested alongside 44 other people by security operatives for alleged terrorism financing linked to Boko Haram. He is now reportedly in the custody of the Defence Intelligence Agency in Abuja.The aggrieved family members, in an interview with Daily Trust, said life had been unbearable for them after Ibrahim's arrest as they stated that he was the only breadwinner, who had been taking care of them and also his relatives.His family members included four wives and 16 children.Speaking on behalf of the family members, one of the wives, Habiba Ibrahim Ladan said the level of hardship they were currently experiencing was taking a toll on them.“I am the fourth wife reaching out on behalf of my co-wives; A’i Ladan Ibrahim, Fatima Ladan Ibrahim, Uwani Ladan Ibrahim, our 16 children and the entire members of his extended families.“We have and are currently experiencing abject hardship since he left. I and the first wife are not in good health. I go to the hospital every month while she goes every week since his departure.“Our children have stopped going to school. Even what to eat is a problem for us; he is the head of the family who supports both his immediate and extended family.”We are really suffering, let him be taken to court, charge him on what they are accusing him of. At least, we know that justice is done to him and to us.”Ladan Ibrahim formally worked with the state’s pilgrims’ welfare board and later with the Ministry for Higher Education in Sokoto State before his arrest.
