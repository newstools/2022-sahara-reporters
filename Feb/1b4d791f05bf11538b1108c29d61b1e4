Chairman of the Standing Committee of Senior Officials of BnL, Mr Godstime Ntukidem, said the pro-Biafra group is “not sleeping”, adding that it will “bite the government where it pains them”. Cameroonian authorities have reportedly ordered troops to hunt for members of the group who allegedly attempted to kidnap two French oil workers in the Bakassi Peninsula on Thursday. BnL, however, did not comment on the incident.The group has been threatening oil companies still operating in the Peninsula. In October 2021, the group ordered the shutdown of borders between Nigeria and Southern Cameroon, in solidarity with the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, who was to appear in court. The group had in a statement by its National Leader, Princewill Richards, said the closure would be between October 19 and 22, along with its operating areas, mainly at Cameroon borders of Cross River, Akwa Ibom and Bakassi Peninsula.
