 The Nigerian government has said that it is only able to bring back Yoruba Nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho from Benin Republic to Nigeria after the “conclusion of his trial in the foreign nation.” Speaking for the government, the Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, stated that there was no possibility of political solution in his (Igboho’s) case, adding that the same principle applied to Nnamdi Kanu. Sunday Igboho The AGF spoke on Monday night on the Channels Television programme. He ruled out any federal government intervention in the trial of the Independent Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) leader Kanu and Yoruba Nation agitator Igboho. Kanu is facing trumped up treasonable felony charges in Abuja while Igboho is being detained by the Republic of Benin authorities over alleged illegal possession of travel documents and entering their country illegally. Igboho’s detention was extended by six months on Sunday. Malami said, “In the cases of Sunday Igboho and Nnamdi Kanu, there is no political solution as they are both facing trials. Igboho – in a foreign land that has its own laws and strategies of delivering justice. “We can only bring Sunday Igboho back to Nigeria after conclusion of his trial in the foreign nation. So, there is no possibility of political solution now on his case. The same thing applies to Kanu Nnamdi, whose case is the court is going on naturally.” On the allegedly implication of DCP Kyari in Hushpuppi’s case, Malami stated, “Multiple jurisdictions are involved. So, within the context of the case, the international community is doing everything to ensure justice is done in the case. “For now, there is a prima facie case of suspicion established against DCP Abba Kyari on the allegation of corruption involving Hushpuppi, though there is no sufficient evidence to proceed with criminal proceedings against him.”
