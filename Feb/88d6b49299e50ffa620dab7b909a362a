Three persons have been crushed to death by a truck loaded with grains in Adamawa State. Of the dead, two were riding a motorcycle while the other was trying to cross the road when the truck rammed into them and crushed them to death.  SaharaReporters learnt that the accident occurred Monday morning at the Viniklang junction, just before the Jimeta bridge on the way into the city centre. It was gathered that the articulated vehicle was speeding down the slope of the Bajabure industrial complex hill when it crushed the three men at the Viniklang junction. Our correspondent who visited the scene, reported that the incident caused traffic congestion at the Jimeta bridge, as irate youths have blocked the highway, threatening to burn the truck. Security personnel comprising the police and civil defence officers have evacuated the remains of those killed. They are also working to contain the angry youths.
