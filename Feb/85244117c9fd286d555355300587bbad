Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urges the European Union to grant his country “immediate” membership, as Russia’s assault against the pro-Western country enters its fifth day. “We appeal to the European Union for the immediate accession of Ukraine via a new special procedure,” the leader says in a new video address.  “Our goal is to be together with all Europeans and, most importantly, to be on an equal footing. I’m sure it’s fair. I’m sure it’s possible,” he says. He says 16 children have died during the first four days of Moscow’s assault and another 45 were wounded as he hailed “Ukrainian heroes,” AFP reports.
