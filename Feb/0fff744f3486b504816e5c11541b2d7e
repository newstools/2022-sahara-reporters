Bola Tinubu Tinubu, who said he was ready to be dirty with anyone in his quest to become the President of the country, said he came to the newly appointed Olubadan and by extension to Ibadan people to solicit their support. “No amount of intimidation can stop me. I am ready to get dirty. I am out to become President of Nigeria. We are at the crossroads,” Tinubu said. “I come here to request for your prayer for me and the Yoruba race. We are at a crossroads, people are volunteering to confront me when they were asked that who would confront the lion of Bourdillion. “I am out to become President of Nigeria. No intimidation, no blackmail can stop me. I have read about a Greek philosopher that if you want to fight a pig, you must be ready to be smeared and I’m ready to be dirty.”
