He was at home over the week for the 3rd day prayer for his uncle who died last week. “One of his drivers was instantly shot and killed; and the other driver, including his personal security details, was grievously injured in the attack. My brother in-law was taken away by the kidnappers. No contact, or random demand, has been made as yet. “These are difficult and trying times for us. While we continue to pray for his safe return, I appeal to his abductors and keepers to release him unharmed to his family and community, Jattu, Uzairue that he has given much love as a father and respected community leader.”
