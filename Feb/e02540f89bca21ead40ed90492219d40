The Niger State Government says it is ready to welcome corps members who are willing to stay back in the terrorists-ravaged state after their service year to contribute to its development.The state governor, Abubakar Sani Bello, made the disclosure at the passing out ceremony of the 2021 Batch ‘A’ Stream 1 Corps members at the 123 quarters parade ground, Minna. Represented by Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Ahmed Ibrahim Matane, Bello said the state was aware of the high level of discipline, dedication and patriotism exhibited by the Corps members throughout their service year in the state.This is amid the grueling security challenges facing the state including the terrorists’ takeover of at least two Local Government Areas of the state as well as wanton kidnappings, banditry and killings.“While commending you for the sense of maturity, loyalty, hard work, and spirit of perseverance, Niger State is ready to welcome corps members that would like to stay back in the State after their service year.“I also charge those deployed to the State to keep the flag of the scheme flying by contributing positively to the development of Nigeria,” the governor urged the corps members.Bello enjoined them to allow the lessons of selflessness and humility learned during their service year to guide them in the obvious realities of life after service.Matane who is also Chairman, NYSC State Governing Board, speaking through the Permanent Secretary, General Services, Musa Rogo Ibrahim said the NYSC Governing Board would ensure the improvement of the general welfare of Corps members in the State to make their stay a memorable one.Earlier in her welcome address, the NYSC State Coordinator, Mrs. Funmilayo Ajayi acknowledged the collective and individual contributions of Corps members to their host communities, particularly in the areas of health, education, agriculture, and rural infrastructure.
