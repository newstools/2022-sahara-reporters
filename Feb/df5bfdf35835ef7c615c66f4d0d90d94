Some students of Abia State University have cried out alleging sexual harassment and intimidation by their Head of Department, Prof Ezinne Enwereji.  The students, who are in Public Health Department, disclosed this in a letter to the school’s management.  They alleged that Enwereji and another lecturer, Lois Ndu Agumuo, were in the habit of fondling students’ private parts in search of explicit materials during examinations.  The students also accused the HOD of deliberately conniving with Agumuo to fail them en masse in her course while failing to accord them adequate tutoring.
