The Police Service Commission (PSC), has claimed that armed robbers have been found in police recruitment camps.  The Commission’s Chairman, Musliu Smith, disclosed this during a one-day sensitisation and town hall meeting on the ongoing police recruitment exercise in Birnin Kebbi on Monday.  Smith enjoined Nigerians to alert the relevant authorities whenever they notice a not-so-good person joining the police force.  He said, “Part of the challenges the commission discovered during recruitment exercises from 2019 was the academic challenges of the applicants which is a sad reflection on the society.  “If our responsible and upright young ones are discouraged from joining the police, where are we going to source for the police officers of our dreams?  “Police and policing are a noble act and deserves the best of the society to join and change the narrative on the issue of internal security of our nation.  “We must raise the alarm if we notice not-so-good persons applying to join the police. There have been cases of robbers finding their way into recruitment camps.  “We must all come together as a community to ensure only the best apply for and are recruited into the Nigeria police.”
