Senator Ibrahim Shekarau-led G-7 has rejected the proposals of the national secretariat of the All Progressives Congress (APC) towards resolving the lingering crisis in the party’s Kano chapter. Senator Shekarau’s G-7 has been at loggerheads with Governor Abdullahi Ganduje’s leadership of the party in the state leading to two parallel executives in the state and ongoing court cases, Daily Trust reports. Ibrahim Shekarau The party’s national secretariat had however attempted to resolve the crisis administratively by meeting with both groups and thereafter issuing a template to address the issues raised by both stakeholders. It had thereafter set up a National/state joint supervisory committee to implement the template with the committee to be headed by Governor Ganduje and assisted by Senator Shekarau. But a few hours after the template was communicated to the groups, the G-7 has written to the national secretariat saying; “that the entirety of the content of your letter is totally unacceptable to us.” The letter was titled “Re: Guidelines for the Harmonisation of the Party Structure in Kano.” They said their reason was that the letter did not acknowledge all the proposals tabled by both parties at the several reconciliation meetings. “We had anticipated that the communication from you would be reflective of the proposals and/or submissions made to you. “Regrettably, however, your said letter to us never contained the proposals and/or submissions put forward by both sides, not even made reference to them,” the letter said. They also said they were disenchanted that the letter had gone viral on social media before it got to them. The signatories to the rejection letter include Senator Shekarau, Senator Barau Jibrin, House of Representative members, Tijjani Abdulkadir Jobe, Nasiru Abduwa Gabasawa, Haruna Dederi and Sha’aban Sharada, as well as the Chairman Buhari Support Group, Shehu Dalhatu.
