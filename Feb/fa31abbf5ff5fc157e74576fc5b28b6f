There is currently pandemonium after a shoot-out occurred this morning in Lagos Island between thugs and officials of the National Drug Law enforcement agency in Lagos State. Eyewitness reports reveal that the agents had come to effect arrests and seize hard drugs when some thugs revolted on Patey Street, Lagos Island.  Several gunshots rang out as the agents battled to bring order to the area. The development is coming a few days after music stars, Zinoleesky and Mohbad, were picked up by the agency for being in possession of hard drugs. Although they have been released, several Nigerians queried why they were manhandled and arrested without a warrant. In a swift response on Friday, the agency’s spokesperson, Femi Babafemi, disclosed that the ID card of an NDLEA agent serves as an ‘arrest’ warrant. Videos on social media revealed that the residents scampered to safety during the gunshots.
