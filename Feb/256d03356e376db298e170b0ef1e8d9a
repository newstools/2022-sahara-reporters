Some public schools’ teachers in Borno State have cried out over the non-payment of their salaries running into eight months.The teachers said they were employed by the current administration led by Prof Babagana Umara Zulum. One of the teachers told SaharaReporters that they were paid for about six months “before the issue of biometrics” arose.He added, “I am writing helplessly, I am a teacher in one of the public schools who were employed by the current administration of so-called and cherished by the title Professor Babagana Umara Zulum the incumbent governor of Borno State. It is known to all Nigerians what happened in Borno (Boko Haram crisis, a belief in illicitness of Western Education), not to gloss over facts.“About 801,000 science-based graduates and NCE holders together were employed to replace thousands of already retired teachers in the state.“It is known that two rams don’t drink at the same time in the same vessel. In other words, we had to leave our life earning employment in order to fully concentrate and deliver what we are employed to do. As I am writing now, the school where I am serving needs more teachers, particularly science disciplines; so also other schools.“Initially when we were employed, the teachers’ service boards were given the mandate to pay our salaries before one could pass through the hell of so-called biometrics.“We were paid for about six months before the issue of biometrics arose. It is exactly eight months now and hundreds of us do not know if we are still employed by the state? Or our duty is being terminated. Almost all of us are either afraid of telling the truth or don’t know how and where to let their voices be heard.“It is also known to all the situation Nigeria is going through, we find it difficult to feed our family and all our children were sent back home from their various schools because we cannot pay their school fees, a number of us were thinking like the life itself is like against us and or like the sky is falling down on us. Kindly speak out louder on our behalf.”
