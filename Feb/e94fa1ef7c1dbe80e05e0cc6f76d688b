The Federal Polytechnic, Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State has released a new dress code that may render the wardrobes of some of their students obsolete.  In a banner placed in front of the school gate, the management banned a wide range of fashion choices common amongst its students.  It warned that the listed items and forms of behaviour would no longer be condoned.  The school listed a number of fashion statements that include coloured hair, baseball caps, tattoos, folded sleeves, pencil trousers, bushy beards and bizarre haircuts.  The polytechnic joins other Nigerian higher institutions such as Bayero University Kano (BUK), University of Ilorin, University of Lagos, Lagos State University and others that have in the past released dress codes for male and female students.
