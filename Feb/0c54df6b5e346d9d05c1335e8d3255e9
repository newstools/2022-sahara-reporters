The Kwara State Government is complicit and failed to act on reports given to its concerning the planned attack on Oyun Baptist High School, in the Ijagbo area of the state, some alumni of the school have said. The alumni noted that the crisis in the Baptist school should have been nipped in the bud because the Kwara State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria called on the government but there was no response. This Day Live The witnesses lamented that the “fundamentalists were able to hurt many Christians, some were macheted, clothes torn and badly beaten”. The alumni demanded that the Kwara State Government should unravel and unveil the hoodlums and extremists causing public disturbance in the name of Hijab enforcement.

3 Weeks Ago In a release sent to SaharaReporters, one of the alumni said, “On 2nd February, 2022, we were informed that some Jihadists had mobilised and were ready to destabilise the academic session of OBHS. "Promptly as early as 6 am, the Ijagbo CAN Chairman called the Chief Imam of Ijagbo of the planned invasion of the OBHS by the fundamentalists, to caution them and await the outcome of the meeting scheduled to hold by 11 am called for by the state government. “Unfortunately, around 6:30 am, without any provocation, the jihadist started shouting 'No Hijab, no school' as they marched in batches to the school. "A few of them were from Ijagbo, most of them were mercenaries from Offa, Ilorin and a number of them were from Osun State. Even Ijagbo Muslims confirmed that most of the faces at the crisis zone were strange in the community. This is to let the public know how calculated and organised the attack was.

3 Weeks Ago “All efforts of the Nigeria Police Force, DSS (Department of State Services), and Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps on the ground to calm these fundamentalists proved abortive. "This is history repeating itself. It was in March/April 2021 that a similar Hijab crisis, which is believed to have been sponsored by the people close to and in the government of Kwara State, ensued and resulted in the brutality of some church members and loss of properties worth millions of naira in Ilorin. “Oyun Baptist High School does not only have a school in it, it has farmlands, Chapel, and other private properties owned by the proprietor.” The alumni raised some posers, saying, “How did the Government circular on hijab enforcement of hijab find its way to Giwa Mosque's Imam in Offa when churches don't have a copy? When did Islamic Clerics become law enforcement agents in Kwara State? Are the armed Jihadist protesters students of OBHS or parents? "Are they from the ministry of education? Was permission taken from necessary Security Agents before the so-called peaceful protest was carried out? Why were they armed, attacking and harassing Christians, students and passersby? Who armed them with weapons and walkie-talkies?" The alumni, therefore, asked the state government to "unravel and unveil those causing public disturbance in the name of Hijab enforcement". The statement further read, "Who are the sponsors of these Jihadists? Where do they get the walkie-talkies and other telecommunication gadgets that were used on the particular day? Why is the State Government causing an avoidable crisis in the state with a religion bias policy? Why try to rob Peter to pay Paul? Why try to hijack Christian heritage acquired through tithes, offering, fundraising and donations for Islam? Why is the State Government giving this secular, multi religion-state an Islamic colouration?

Hijab Crisis: Kwara Government Sends Delegation To Baptist School, Ijagbo Community

2 Weeks Ago “We hope that the Kwara State Government will not through this act of religious bigotry, project Kwara State to the world at large as a crisis-loving state again. We appeal to the Kwara State Government to tread the path of lasting peace by rescinding this policy that is causing general unrest in the state and leading to disruption of students’ academic calendar. The students of OBHS are out of school now, including those preparing for junior and senior (secondary school) examinations. “Kwara State Government should respect sections 43 and 44 of the Nigeria Constitution 1999 as amended. We appeal that the Kwara State Government live up to its promise by returning the Christian Grant Aided Mission schools to their proprietors.”
