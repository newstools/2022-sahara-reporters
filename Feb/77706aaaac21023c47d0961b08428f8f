Aloy Ejimakor, special counsel for Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, on Thursday, again lamented the refusal by the operatives of the Department of State Services to grant him access to his client. Ejimakor on Monday also lamented that the DSS barred Kanu’s lawyers from seeing their client for the second time, while the brother of the IPOB leader, Prince Emmanuel, expressed fear that Kanu’s life might be in danger.  On Thursday, Ejimakor tweeted, “Three times in a row, the Government of Nigeria (via DSS) blocks court-ordered access to Onyendu Nnamdi Kanu on the same excuses. We were here in strength - My humble self, Ozekhome, Ejiofor & Prince Emma. This crass tyranny will live in infamy & harden a lot of hearts.” In a post on his Twitter handle on Monday, Ejimakor said the DSS had barred lawyers to the detained IPOB leader from meeting Kanu last Thursday and on Monday.  The lawyer noted that the DSS was in contravention of the order of Justice Binta Nyako of a Federal High Court in Abuja, who said Kanu should be allowed to meet his lawyers twice a week – Mondays and Thursdays. Ejimakor had said, “Last Thursday, we were not allowed visitation with Onyendu because, according to DSS, the ‘special squad’ in charge of visitations went on ‘outside assignment’. They asked us to come on Monday (today). “Today, we‘re at DSS. They’re telling us the same thing. We disagree.” https://twitter.com/AloyEjimakor/status/1496852967743541251?s=20&t=UE870Y65aF4GQf4i-PiQtg
