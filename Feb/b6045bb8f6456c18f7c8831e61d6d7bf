Some aides of National Assembly members have alleged that funds meant to pay their salaries and allowances have been diverted.The aides picketed the headquarters of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) on Monday.The legislative aides said the non-payment of their entitlements had turned them to “slaves.” File photo used to illustrate story.



In a petition dated February 14, 2022, and addressed to EFCC Chairman, Abdulrasheed Bawa and ICPC Chairman, Bolaji Owasanoye, the aides said they were also being owed Duty Tour Allowance (DTA), Minimum Wage Arrears from January 2020, trainings among others.The petition signed by Zebis Kekung and Kingsley Ejekwu Esq. for Concerned Legislative Aides of the 9th National Assembly, reads: “The non-payment of these accumulated legitimate entitlements has turned legislative aides into legislative slaves.“We have been pauperized to the extent that we are unable to meet our financial obligations like payment of school fees, hospital bills, house rents, debt servicing, putting us into several embarrassing situations.“All avenues we employed in appealing to the consciences of the President of the Senate Senator (Dr.) Ahmad Lawan, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rt. Hon. ‘Femi Gbajabiamila and the Clerk of the National Assembly, Arch. Amos Ojo has proved abortive hence the last recourse to this petition.“It is instructive to note that legislative aides’ affairs are directly under the purview of the Speaker. We are therefore beseeching you to use your good office to investigate this criminal diversion of our budgeted legitimate entitlements, bring the culprits to book and ensure the prompt payment of the allowances and arrears to us.“For the avoidance of doubts, our prayers are: payment of our salary arrears that was duly appropriated; payment of our DTA allowance and training allowance including laptops; payment of our minimum wages from January 2020 till date and transparency in the management of Legislative Aides account to avoid breach of the Fiscal Responsibility Act, 2007”.The petition was also copied to President Muhammadu Buhari; Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; the Inspector General of Police, Alkali Baba Usman and Director General, State Security Service (SSS), Yusuf Bichi.Others were; Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly Matters (Senate), Senator Babajide Omoworare; Social Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP); BUDGiT; Policy and Legal Advocacy Centre (PLAC) and Human Rights Radio.
