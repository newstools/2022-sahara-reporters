Family members are in dispute over the estate of Daniel arap Moi, who was Kenya's president from 1978 to 2002  Collins Kibet, a grandson of Daniel arap Moi, former Kenyan president, has been evicted from his house over unpaid rent that has accumulated to more than $2,100 (£1,550 or about N1.2 million) in six months.  It comes amid a court case as Mr Moi's relatives battle over the management of the family estate, BBC News reports.  Collins Kibet, 45, told a court that he was broke and unable to pay his rent or provide for his family, adding that he was evicted last week.  He accused his relatives including his stepmother - who are administrators of his father’s estate - of excluding him from inheriting his father's wealth.  Mr Kibet’s father Jonathan Toroitich, Mr Moi's son, died in 2019 without leaving a will. The family’s wealth is estimated to be vast.  Mr Kibet wants the court to bar his step-mother and step-brother from acting as administrators and to be included as a beneficiary of the family estate.  Mr Moi was Kenya's longest-serving president. He was in office for 24 years, until intense pressure forced him to step down in 2002.
