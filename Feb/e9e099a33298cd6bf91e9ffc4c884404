Abdulmalik Tanko, the main suspect in the kidnap and murder case of five-year-old Hanifa Abubakar has begged a Kano court on Monday to provide a lawyer to represent him as he doesn’t have one. The police in January 2020 arrested three suspects, including Abdulmalik, over the abduction and killing of Hanifa.  Her lifeless body was discovered inside Northwest Preparatory school in Kano city, Kano State capital. Abdulmalik, who was Hanifa’s school proprietor appeared in court with two other suspects but the case could not go on as they had no lawyer to represent them, BBC Pidgin reports. "I don’t have a lawyer at the moment because we don’t have access to anyone but I’m begging the government to provide me with one," Abdulmalik said.

Prosecution lawyer, Musa Lawal said the government would provide the suspects with a lawyer by next week when there will be another hearing. Abubakar Abdulsalam, the late Hanifa’s father said he was still traumatised by what happened to his daughter. He, however, added that he knew it was a test from God.

2 Weeks Ago "She came to meet me to say she was prepared for Islamiyah (Islamic school). I told her to pray and, in my presence, she repeated the prayer. "After, she turned to her mother and said, ‘Mummy, buy Alewar madara (milk candy) for me from the market.'" Those were the final moments Abubakar spent with his daughter. "I will always remember that Hanifa was a very lively and smart girl, all our neighbours loved her and her father was her favourite," Abubakar added.
