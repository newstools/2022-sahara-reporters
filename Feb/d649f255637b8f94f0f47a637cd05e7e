Vehicular movements and other economic activities were brought to a standstill on Friday for several hours when protesters mostly truckers blocked the Gwaram-Basirka Road in Jigawa State.  Their grouse was the continued closure of the popular Gwaram Bridge, which links the Jigawa to Bauchi and Gombe states, Daily Trust reports.  Recall that the state government had in August announced the closure of the bridge to articulated vehicles as part of measures to carry out repairs on the damaged portions of the bridge.  The protesters, mostly youths, blocked the road thereby preventing vehicles from coming from both sides.  Travellers going to Bauchi and Gombe states from Kano and Jigawa states were made to spend several hours on the road.  Travellers were forced to disembark and trek to the other end of the road to continue their journeys.  However, the Divisional Police Officer in Gwaram, Mohammed Wakili, stakeholders and the district head of Gwaram pacified the protesters, who agreed to open the road after giving the government a three-day ultimatum to provide an alternative route for their trucks.
