Two policemen have been killed as gunmen attacked the Isu Divisional Police headquarters in the Isu Local Government Area of Imo State.The police have, however, said they have arrested 18 of the attackers. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, CSP Mike Abattam, said armed men suspected to be members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB)/Eastern Security Network (ESN) in their numbers went to the station in two Toyota Sienna Buses, a Toyota Camry Car and an unspecified number of motorcycles, on Sunday.He said the hoodlums took advantage of the porous neighbourhood and attacked the station from the rear axis, shooting sporadically, throwing petrol bombs and Improvised Explosive Devices (I.E.D) that ignited the station.Abattam said that the fire and Improvised Explosives Devices (IED) affected some vehicles and part of the building of the division.He said that the police operatives of the division immediately responded by engaging the hoodlums in a gun duel.Due to the superior fire-power of the police, the hoodlums were dealt a heavy blow and they scampered for safety, running in different directions with various degrees of gunshot wounds, he added.The police said, “The operatives did not relent; they gave the hoodlums a hot chase and while escaping some ran into Golden Suite Hotel and Isu Villa Hotel respectively.“The two hotels were immediately cordoned and raided and in the process, a total of 12 motorcycles without identification numbers and two vehicles – one Lexus RX350 SUV and one Lexus RX330 SUV – believed to have been used by the hoodlums were seen and recovered.”Also, 17 males and a female suspect were arrested and undergoing interrogation, the police added.
