The panel inaugurated by the Zamfara State Chief Judge, Kulu Aliyu, to investigate allegations against the deputy governor, Mahadi Aliyu Gusau, has submitted its report to the state House of Assembly amidst tight Security. The development is coming less than 24 hours after the panel concluded its public hearing with assurances that it will be fair to all parties.  The seven-man panel was set up to investigate allegations of gross misconduct and abuse of office levelled against Aliyu Gusau. The panel has Justice Halidu Tanko-Soba as Chairman, with Oladipo Okpeseyi (SAN), Abdul-Atadoga Ibrahim (SAN), Hussaini Zakariyau, (SAN), Amina Tanimu-Marafa, Alhaji Sani Mande and Ahmad Buhari-Rabah, as members. SaharaReporters reported that the House of Assembly had taken steps to impeach the deputy governor. Eighteen members of the assembly voted in support of the impeachment which made Aliyu inaugurate the panel. The deputy governor has refused to join Governor Bello Matawalle to defect to the All Progressives Congress (APC) from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Mahadi, who is a son of a former Minister of Defence, Ali Gusau, argued that the Supreme Court awarded the electoral victory in 2019 to the PDP and not just its candidates. In a press briefing on Sunday evening, he said no panel could investigate him because the case is before a court of law.
