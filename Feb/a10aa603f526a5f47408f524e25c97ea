State governors, who had been part of the 2022 Committee, an idea set up to fashion out a future for the county ahead of the 2023 general elections, have reportedly pulled out, citing a different agenda by the conveners, First Weekly reports.According to the governors, who have been allegedly joined by some senators in their decision to stay away from the committee, it was an agenda to propagate the 2023 presidential bid of the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele.

The state governors were said to have pulled out of the idea to avoid being tagged agents of Emefiele’s presidential bid.A state governor from the Northern part of the country reportedly called his Southern counterpart to ensure that the governors were not used as pawns and advised that henceforth none of them should attend the committee’s meetings or promote its activities in any way.Despite media reports about his intention to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in office in 2023, Emefiele has consistently denied that he nurses the ambition.The CBN governor's friends have since gone to town with a three-page advertorial in some national newspapers, where his “achievements” were listed, raising suspicion of his presidential ambition.It was gathered that some senators, who had been part of the deal, have also seen the wisdom in the governors' decision to pull out of the project.Sources revealed that one of the chief promoters of the agenda, a media guru, was using the agency of one of his former staff members to promote the group’s agenda.They are worried that if Emefiele, who has been unable to resolve the simple foreign exchange crisis since he was appointed CBN governor, how would he tackle the nation’s multi-faceted crises.Besides, they are of the view that if the committee is truly patriotic, it should have known that the CBN governor has since been under investigation regarding five different cases, personally ordered by the President, thus, pushing to succeed Buhari was nothing but a personal agenda.The governors said the political class could not have laboured so hard all the while only to hand over the leadership of the country to a clueless fellow under whatever excuse.Emefiele, who hails from Delta State, became the CBN Governor in 2014.
