Some youths of the All Progressives Congress under the aegis of APC Youth Development and Solidarity Forum on Monday protested at the National Assembly, while alleging that some governors in the party were planning to hijack proceedings at the forthcoming National Convention.The group urged President Muhammadu Buhari to reject the plans, asserting that it was worried that the governors were orchestrating the move so as to single-handedly pick the chairman and other positions in the party. The President of the group,  Danelsi Momoh, made this known while speaking during a protest at the National Assembly on Monday, noting that if such plan materialised, it would tear the party apart.The group urged the president to allow a level playing field for all candidates during the party’s convention.He said, “We are consequently pained with the action of some governors in our party who are desperately trying to undermine the democratic process by attempting to deceive you and other party members into endorsing a fraudulent list of candidates at the party’s national convention.“They want to single-handedly pick the chairman of our party and other candidates for leadership position during the convention.“This is undemocratic and must not be allowed to see the light of the day. It has the potential of disintegrating the party before the convention slated date.“We call on the president as the father of the party and in line with your stance on transparency and accountability, to reject the governors and their plans and equally consult other stakeholders like the forum of ex-governors in the party to make an input.”“The president should consult members of our party in the National Assembly which has the biggest caucus in the party towards finding an amicable resolution of the impending crisis,” he added
