Former Vice President of Nigeria, Atiku Abubakar, says he is confident that he will win the presidential ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party. According to Daily Trust, Atiku said this on Saturday when he spoke with journalists shortly after a meeting with former President Olusegun Obasanjo over his presidential bid.  He was said to have arrived at the penthouse residence located within Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library, Abeokuta, Ogun State, at 10:10am and went straight into the meeting with Obasanjo. Although Atiku has not officially declared his presidential bid, he has reportedly commenced consultations ahead of his declaration. Raymond Dokpesi, PDP chieftain, who heads Atiku’s presidential campaign technical committee, has been traversing the country to promote him to Nigerians. Speaking with journalists after the one-hour long meeting, the former Vice President said he would soon make a formal declaration of his intention to run in 2023. “Have I ever failed to get the ticket? I’m confident,” he said. When asked to allow the younger presidential aspirants contest for presidency, Atiku said, “Let the youth compete now. It is a competition. It’s democracy.” Atiku and his team are said to be currently meeting with Adedotun Gbadebo, paramount ruler of Egbaland, at the Ake palace.
