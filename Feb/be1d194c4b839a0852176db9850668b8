The Adamawa State Police Command has denied receiving any complaint against Deputy Commissioner of police, Ibrahim Babazango, who allegedly threatened a Southeasterner for acquiring a house next to his own in the state.SaharaReporters had on February 9, 2022, reported that DCP Babazango threatened violent attacks against one Vincent Umeh for buying property near his house in Adamawa State. It was learnt that the police boss, who hails from Adamawa State, claimed he did not want a southerner as his next-door neighbour.Babazango, who is currently attached to the Lagos State Police Command, was reportedly infuriated to learn that a Southeasterner was his new neighbour.Spokesperson for the command, DSP Suleiman Nguroje in a statement on Thursday, denied that Vincent Umeh had lodged a complaint with the command.He said, “The attention of the Adamawa State Police Command has been drawn to a misleading and fabricated publication with a caption, “Police officer gives violence threats to a buyer of property near his Adamawa House.” "The publication is nothing but a calculated attempt to smear the image of the police. As a matter of fact, the command has not received any complaint of threat from one Mr .Umeh as alleged in an online publication."The command has contacted the Senior Police Officer, DCP Ibrahim Baba Zango, an indigene of Adamawa and found out that the allegations are not true,” he said.However, investigation by SaharaReporters revealed that Umeh, the complainant, had actually lodged a complaint at the Zone 3 Police command Yola, as well as the Department of State Services.A copy of the complaint seen by SaharaReporters read in parts, “Complaint of criminal intimidation/threat against Babazango."I could remember sometimes in December, 2021, I bought a house close to my shop from one Baba Tsoho with GSM No 08037335320 of Mohammed Mustapha Way J/Yola at the cost of N16million and paid cash through bank transfer.“Then on February 2, 2022 at about 1527hrs the above named person (police officer) called me with GSM No 08039519033, threatening me that if I tamper with the house I bought, he will send his boys to kill me. He warned me and I recorded our conversation", he added.SaharaReporters had also obtained an audio of the said recorded conversation containing the alleged threat.Meanwhile, the senior cop has dragged the matter before the court of law, according to a court summons issued to Umeh on Wednesday.According to the summons seen by SaharaReporters, Umeh is due to appear before the Upper Area Court in Yola, the state capital, on February 11, 2022.
