Former Senate President, Bukola Saraki, is currently trending on Twitter following reports of a planned interview with EndSARS campaigner, Rinu Oduala. Netizens, who took to their handles on the microblogging platform, have since criticised Rinu over her involvement with the politician.  Some social media users knocked the activist for planning to host the politician on her Twitter space after she allegedly dragged skit makers, who paid a visit to Vice President of Nigeria, Yemi Osinbajo. Rinu was part of netizens, who faulted the decision of the skit makers including Apaokagi Maryam better known as Taooma for paying a visit to the Vice President in November 2021. After several allegations were levelled against Taooma at the time, the skit maker apologised to Nigerian youth.
