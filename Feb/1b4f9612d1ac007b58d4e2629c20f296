President Muhammadu Buhari approved the creation of the agency. Buhari also approved the recommendation of the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof Isa Ali Pantami, to have Dr. Vincent Olatunji serve as the National Commissioner/Chief Executive Officer of the Bureau.  Olatunji was the Director of the eGovernment Development and Regulations Department at NITDA. The establishment of the agency followed a request made by the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof Isa Ali Pantami. A statement issued by Uwa Suleiman, media aide to the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy and on his behalf, said the new agency will focus on data protection and privacy for the country, among others.  “This has increased the importance of having an institution that focuses on data protection and privacy.  “Furthermore, the issuance of the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) in January 2019, as a subsidiary legislation to the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) Act 2007, has increased awareness about the need for data protection and privacy,” he said.
