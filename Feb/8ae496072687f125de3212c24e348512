Aircraft of the Nigerian Air Force under Operation Thunder Strike have bombed at least 20 terrorists otherwise known as bandits, who were heading for the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) in Kaduna State.Credible intelligence sources told PRNigeria that the bandits, riding on over 50 motorcycles, were seen on Thursday evening, advancing towards the Academy, in Kaduna State. Recall that gunmen, suspected to be bandits, invaded the military academic institution, in June 2021.During the previous attack, a Nigerian Army Captain was abducted as the criminals shot two soldiers dead.Following a tip-off on movement of bandits through the military school’s general areas on Thursday, two Nigerian Air Force (NAF) helicopter gunships were dispatched to engage the criminals, who had taken off from Damari village in the Birnin Gwari Local Government Area.The bandits, in their numbers, were sighted in makeshift tents and motorcycles amounting up to 50.“On sighting the aircraft, the bandits started fleeing into the fringes of the forest. This brought about an objective and very decisive rain of hell from above on the miscreants as surviving bandits seen to be scampering for safety from the superior air presence were effectively mopped up.“Moreso as it is customary, feedback received on Friday, after the operation from both the ground forces and local sources, revealed that the bandits were effectively disoriented and suffered a loss of about 20 bandits.“Also, their plans of harassing and shaming the Nigerian Defence Academy and the Government of the day were effectively thwarted,” he said.
