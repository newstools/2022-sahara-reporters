The hearing of a suit filed by a group challenging the police over the suspension of disgraced Deputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari, suffered a setback on Thursday due to the absence of the trial judge, Justice Donatus Okorowo.The suit was instituted by the Incorporated Trustees of Northern Peace Foundation against the police over the suspension of the embattled police detective. The foundation, in a suit, marked FHC/ABJ/CS/854/2021, sought to stop the police and the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) from arresting and extraditing DCP Kyari, NAN reports.The suit, which was filed by the group on August 9, 2021, is praying the court to grant a temporary order of injunction against the police and the AGF pending the hearing and final determination of the substantive suit.The court had earlier sat on January 12 but could not continue with the proceedings due to the absence of counsel to the plaintiff and the respondents in the suit.Justice Okorowo then adjourned the matter until Thursday, February 10, 2022, for a hearing.The case, which was initially before Justice Ahmed Mohammed, was reassigned to Okorowo.Okorowo, in the last adjourned date, ordered that hearing notices be issued on the parties.The hearing which was supposed to continue on Thursday was however stalled due to the absence of Justice Okorowo.The registrar of the court apologised to Hamza N’Dantani, counsel to the applicant over the inability of the judge to sit.The matter, which was on number six on the cause list, has been fixed for April 4 for hearing.In July 2021, the United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation revealed how Kyari allegedly collaborated with Hushpuppi to jail one of the latter’s associates after a dispute over a $1.1million scam on Qatari businesspeople.The FBI also alleged that the embattled social media celebrity sent money to Kyari via a third person’s bank account and hosted him in his Dubai apartment.According to the US Department of Justice, a criminal complaint initiated the prosecution of Hushpuppi as court documents showed that Abbas, 37, pleaded guilty.The United States Attorney’s Office, Central District of California, had issued an arrest warrant against Kyari.Hushpuppi has since pleaded guilty to the charges and if convicted risks a 20-year-jail term, three-year supervision upon completion of jail term, and monetary restitution to the tune of $500,000 or more.The court documents also outlined a dispute among members of the Hushpuppi conspiracy, which allegedly prompted him to arrange to have an individual identified as ‘co-conspirator’ Kelly Chibuzor Vincent, jailed in Nigeria by DCP Kyari.Following the allegations, the top detective was suspended and a panel was set up by the Inspector-General of Police to probe the FBI allegations.But Kyari denied the allegations, claiming that his “hands are clean”.
