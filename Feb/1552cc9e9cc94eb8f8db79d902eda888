President Muhammadu Buhari has said he is eager to leave a legacy at the end of his tenure in 2023. Buhari made the assertion while interacting with the business community, civil Society groups and the media even as his tenure entered the last lap.  Buhari, who defeated the incumbent president, Goodluck Jonathan in 2015, claimed he would like to leave office having consolidated on his achievements. According to the President, despite inheriting enormous problems upon assumption of office, almost seven years down the line, he could look back with satisfaction that this administration had kept faith with the people. The president said, “I am gradually entering my final year in office. It is a period I intend to spend not only on consolidating on the achievements of the past seven years but also to leave a legacy for a united, peaceful, and prosperous Nigeria. “I take this initiative to mean that you all intend to collaborate with this administration in that direction. “For those among you who are politicians, you must look beyond gaining power to how you can leverage public positions in the process of societal change. To the businessmen and women among you, there is great glory in public service. “The question that should be uppermost always is; how do we leverage our business endowment for the greater good of our country?".
