The whereabouts of a man, Agubata Maxwell, has become a source of worry after he was reportedly arrested by policemen attached to the Imo State Police Command.SaharaReporters gathered that Maxwell was arrested on December 11, 2021 by men of the anti-kidnapping unit of the command over a car he bought which the officers said belonged to a kidnapped victim. But the state Police spokesman, Orlando Ikeokwu when contacted, said he was not aware of the said arrest. “I don’t know anything about the story. The police command is very big, maybe you can come and see things for yourself,” he said.But a source told SaharaReporters that all efforts to find Mawell during numerous visits to the anti-kidnapping unit had been unsuccessful.“I wish to bring to your attention an important issue; on 11th of December, 2021, Mr Agubata Maxwell was arrested by Imo State anti-kidnapping squad, in connection with a car he bought which they said belong to a kidnapped victim.“But I was told that Mr Agubata Maxwell kept telling the police that he knew nothing about the kidnap apart from the car he bought, of which they had arrested the kidnapper. Up till today 28th February 2022, neither Agubata Maxwell’s lawyer nor his family members know his whereabouts.“The police have refused to charge him to court since December 2021. The lawyer has filed a case in court and invited the police, of which they failed to show up. If they (the police) have killed him, they should come out and say.”
