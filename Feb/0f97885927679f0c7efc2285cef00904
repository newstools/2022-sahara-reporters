The 2022 UEFA Champions League final originally billed to hold in Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg, Russia has been moved away by the European football governing body, UEFA after Russia attacked Ukraine on Thursday. It was learnt that UEFA executive committee will on Friday hold an extraordinary meeting to discuss the geopolitical crisis along with moving the fixture out of Russia, according to The Associated Press.  UEFA in a statement said, “Following the evolution of the situation between Russia and Ukraine in the last 24 hours, the UEFA president has decided to call an extraordinary meeting of the executive committee …. in order to evaluate the situation and take all necessary decisions.” According to the report, the British government and fan groups had asked UEFA to move the game from the St. Petersburg stadium sponsored by Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom following the increased threat of invading Ukraine from Russia. The Fans Supporters Europe group on Thursday showed their support to Ukraine, tweeting, “On this tragic day, our thoughts are with everyone in Ukraine, our friends, colleagues, members, & their loved ones.”
