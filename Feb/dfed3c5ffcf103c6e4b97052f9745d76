The Police Service Commission has ordered the police to conclude an investigation into the case of suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari, within two weeks.This was made known in a statement issued by the Head, Press and Public Relations, Ikechukwu Ani. The commission also ordered that the investigation should be carried out by a different panel.The decision was taken at the continuation of its 14th Plenary Meeting which ended in Abuja on Friday, chaired by retired Inspector-General of Police and Chairman of the Commission, Alhaji Musiliu Smith.In July 2021, the United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation revealed how Kyari allegedly collaborated with a self-confessed fraudster, Abass Ramon, aka Hushpuppi to jail one of the latter’s associates after a dispute over a $1.1million scam on Qatari businessperson.The FBI also alleged that the embattled social media celebrity sent money to Kyari via a third person’s bank account and hosted him in his Dubai apartment.According to the US Department of Justice, a criminal complaint initiated the prosecution of Hushpuppi as court documents showed that Abbas, 37, pleaded guilty.The United States Attorney’s Office, Central District of California, had issued an arrest warrant against Kyari.Hushpuppi has since pleaded guilty to the charges and if convicted risks a 20-year-jail term, three-year supervision upon completion of jail term, and monetary restitution to the tune of $500,000 or more.The court documents also outlined a dispute among members of the Hushpuppi conspiracy, which allegedly prompted him to arrange to have an individual identified as ‘co-conspirator’ Kelly Chibuzor Vincent, jailed in Nigeria by DCP Kyari.Following the allegations, the top detective was suspended and a panel was set up by the Inspector-General of Police to probe the FBI allegations.But Kyari denied the allegations, claiming that his “hands are clean”.
