Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State alongside with some chieftains of the Peoples Democratic Party on Wednesday stormed the Plateau State High Court sitting in Jos where a former Governor of the state, Jonah Jang, was arraigned.According to reports, Wike and the PDP chieftains were in court to show support for their colleague, former Plateau governor, Jang who is standing trial over alleged misappropriation of state funds during his tenure in office. He is standing trial alongside Yusuf Pam, an ex-cashier in the office of the Secretary to the Government of the State, on alleged N6.3billion fraud charges brought before the court by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission.The duo was first arraigned before Justice Daniel Longji in March 2018 on 17 counts bordering on criminal breach of trust and misappropriation of public funds but they had since pleaded not guilty to the charges.The case is before Justice Christy Dabup who started hearing on the matter afresh following the retirement of Justice Longji in December 2019, after hearing the matter 34 times.Wike had reportedly expressed the party’s concern on the lingering misunderstanding between Jang and the governorship aspirant of the party in the state, Retired Lt Gen Jeremiah Useni.
