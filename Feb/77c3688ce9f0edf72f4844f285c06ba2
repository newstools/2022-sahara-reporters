Suspected political thugs have set fire on the Gombe state secretariat of the People Democratic Party (PDP) on Monday night. According to Sun, the PDP office which is along Bachi road in the state as well as the Atiku House were both set on fire alongside documents, chairs and other valuables in the buildings.  A PDP supporter, Muntari Yau Kulsi, said the office was set on fire at around 1:30am. He said the secretariat was up and running on till 1:20am that he left the office. When asked about the origin or source of the fire Kulsi laughed and said, “The source is All Progressives Congress (APC) and its people. Both offices that are about four kilometres away from each other cannot naturally catch fire at once. “Our men here saw the thugs, they came in three cars with several weapons, the security guard stationed at the office were overpowered by the thugs and had to run for their lives,” he said. He, however, said men of the fire service close to the office battled to control the inferno. He added that the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) in charge of the Pantami division was quickly at the scene. He said, “We are just waiting for our leaders to decide on what to do, but we all knew the people that did this and we will go after them.” The opposition party is said to have initiated a plan to embark on a protest to seek justice, while also, the Atiku Campaign Organisation is preparing to address the public and disclose possible actions to be taken.
