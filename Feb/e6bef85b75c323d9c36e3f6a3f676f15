The Academic Staff Union of Universities has declared a national strike. The strike will be total, the lecturers’ union said at a press conference on Monday.  This comes after a long meeting of the National Executive Council of ASUU in Lagos, which dragged into the early hours of Monday.  The ASUU President, Prof. Emmanuel Osodeke, who addressed journalists, said the industrial action would be comprehensive. The demands of the union include the payment of Earned Academic Allowance, revitalisation fund, the replacement of the Integrated Personnel Payroll Information System (IPPIS), with the University Transparency and Accountability System (UTAS). The union had on November 15, 2021, given the Nigerian government a three-week ultimatum over its failure to meet the demands.
