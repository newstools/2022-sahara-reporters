 A former governor of Imo State and chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Rochas Okorocha has said he sees members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) as children who lack adequate education. Okorocha said the pro-Biafra group, IPOB became a terrorist group because of the way their matter was handled.  The presidential aspirant said this while addressing State House correspondents after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday. Okorocha said, “There was no need to have handled the IPOB matter the way it was handled. Today they have turned out to be terrorists. “But for me, I don’t see them as terrorists. I see them as children who have not been properly educated on the happenings.” IPOB has been clamouring for the independent state of Biafra. Its leader, Nnamdi Kanu, is currently in detention and being tried by the Nigerian government for terrorism and other related offences at the Federal High Court in Abuja.
