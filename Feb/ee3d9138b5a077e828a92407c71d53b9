The Nigerian Army says troops of 144 Battalion, Madagali in conjunction with Civilian JTF have killed an unspecified number of Boko Haram (BH) and Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) terrorists in Adamawa State. According to the army on its Twitter page, AK-47 rifles, bicycles amongst other items were recovered from the terrorists.  “Based on intelligence report, today troops of 144 Battalion Madagali-Adamawa State in conjunction with Civilian JTF laid an ambush on withdrawing ISWAP/BHT after a superiority clash between the terror groups. Scores of terrorists were neutralized at Mandara mountains,” the army tweeted. Since the death of JAS leader, Abubakar Shekau, ISWAP has been consolidating its grip in locations around Lake Chad. Last year, it appointed Wali Sani Shuwaram, a 45-year-old as the new Leader (Wali) of ISWAP in Lake Chad. The sect’s membership has swollen with the defection of hundreds of Boko Haram fighters under Shekau. The terror group has caused over 100,000 deaths and displaced millions of people mainly in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe states.
