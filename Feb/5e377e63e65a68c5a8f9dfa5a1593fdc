The wife of the President, Aisha Buhari, Thursday travelled from Kaduna to Abuja by train. It was learnt that she had arrived in Kaduna from Kano by air to pay a condolence visit to the family of five-year-old Hanifa Abubakar killed by her school proprietor, Abdulmalik Tanko, Daily Trust reports.  But Mrs Buhari joined the train for the trip back to Abuja in order to encourage more Nigerians to use that mode of transportation. She was said to be in the company with her younger brother, Mahmud Ahmad, also known as Modi, and a few aides. Many Nigerians including politicians have been using the Abuja-Kaduna train to avoid travelling by road as the Abuja-Kaduna highway has been overtaken by bandits and kidnappers.
