The Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), on Wednesday, condemned in strong terms a statement credited to Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu (SAN), that any political party that fields a northern candidate in the 2023 presidential election will lose. During a courtesy visit to the governor by members of the Power Rotation Movement, led by its Chairman, Pogu Bitrus, Akeredolu said Southern governors are determined to ensure that the next President of the country comes from their region. Ondo State Governor Rotimi Akeredolu There are 17 states in the South while the North has 19, making 36. Reacting to Akeredolu's statement on Wednesday, the ACF through its National Publicity Secretary, Emmanuel Yawe, said the governor should stop issuing threats. According to the ACF, threats will not give the Southern region the Presidency in 2023, noting that Akeredolu should know better as a senior lawyer. He said, “As a very senior lawyer, Governor Akeredolu should know the provisions of the constitution. It is therefore not possible for a group of states to come together and say we ‘must’ produce the president. Anybody eying that seat must traverse the country, north and south to meet the demands of the Constitution,” the statement read.
