President Muhammadu Buhari has stated that his administration’s pledge to end the protracted insurgency war and return peace to the North-East region still stands. Speaking at the inauguration of the Presidential Committee on the Repatriation, Return and Resettlement of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in the North-East of Nigeria, Buhari vowed that his government would not relent in efforts towards a return to peace and normalcy. He, therefore, pledged that Nigerians in the region would in the coming months, witness a change from the protracted insurgency to peace and development in their respective communities. He said, “At the advent of this administration in 2015, I pledged to Nigerians that I will restore peace in the North-East and return it to the path of development and growth. I remain committed to this promise.“To the people of the North-East, particularly the children and future of the North-East, we will never forget you and your courage, sacrifice and endurance have been exemplary.“I pledge to you that in the coming months you will begin to witness a shift away from a protracted insurgency to peace-building, stabilisation, and ultimately development in your respective communities as we embark on a revised approach to addressing this conflict - a return to normalcy.”He added that the committee’s terms of reference entail a shift from managing the situation to activating a permanent solution for effective and practicable restoration.The committee, according to him, is expected to develop a concise three-year action plan by the end of March 2022 that incorporates national and state-level plans, providing a clear pathway for the restoration of peace and development in the North-East.He added that the committee would also develop and implement a phased plan for the repatriation, returns, resettlement of IDPs and restoration of livelihoods, incorporating global best practices that give dignity to the affected populations.It will also be responsible for the development and implementation of a coordinated peacebuilding and reconciliation programme that is culturally appropriate and community-driven.Similarly, the committee is also saddled with the responsibility of strengthening collaboration with key donors, development partners and private sector organisations that are critical to the mobilisation of resources and implementation of programmes.President Buhari charged the committee members to adopt the guiding principles of accountability, delineation of duty and community-driven methods to address issues.
