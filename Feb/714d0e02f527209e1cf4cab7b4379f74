At least 13 people were reportedly killed by fighters from the Islamic State for West African Province, ISWAP, within 48 hours in Borno State, Northeast Nigeria. ISWAP on Sunday reportedly attacked Sabongari village, a few kilometres from Damboa town in the Damboa Local Government Area of the state.  “The attackers left seven people dead,” local vigilantes told Daily Post on Sunday. This comes barely 24 hours after an attack was reported in Mandaragirau and Ghuma villages in the Biu Local Government Area. It was also less than 48 hours after the insurgents attacked Kautikari village in Chibok, leaving several persons dead. Locals in Mandaragirau village said this is the second time the insurgents will be attacking their village in February. According to them, the first time, they abducted some young men from the village, who are still in captivity. The attack in Mandaragirau village left three persons dead with scores injured, according to locals from the area. “In Ghuma village, they abducted two girls and looted food items. They also razed down shops and took some livestock with them,” a witness, Umar Audu, said.
