The President Muhammadu Buhari-led government has been urged to grant the leader of the Islamic movement, Sheikh Ibraheem Zakzaky and his wife, Malama Zeenatuddin Ibrahim, their travel documents to enable them seek medical treatments.The Advocate for Social Justice, a group concerned about the plight of Sheikh Ibraheem El-Zakzaky, made the appeal on Friday, in a statement signed by its Publicity Secretary, Mr. Segun Fanimo .The group asserted that the couple was discharged and acquitted by the Kaduna State High Court and therefore, should be given their travelling documents to treat themselves of various ailments.They explained that even Buhari took time off from duty to attend to his health situation outside Nigeria, adding that there was no justification to deny the Shiites leader to go to any country to attend to his worsening health condition.The statement reads, “As you are aware, it has been over six months since the leader of the Islamic Movement, Sheikh Ibraheem Zakzaky and his wife were acquitted and discharged by Kaduna State High Court, after spending almost six years in illegal detention.“Judge Gideon Kurada had, in his ruling delivered on July 30, 2021, upheld the no case submission by the counsel to the defendant, Femi Falana SAN.“Their medical situation was not good in addition to their mismanaged life threatening gunshot injuries and numerous health complications that require serious intervention; as a result of which their health condition woefully deteriorated from bad to worse.“Information available indicates that their health condition is deteriorating as Sheikh could be seen limping and his wife, Malama Zeenatuddin Ibrahim confined to a wheelchair.“We call on President Muhammadu Buhari and the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice to release the Sheikh and his wife’s  travel documents so that they can seek medical attention abroad.”
