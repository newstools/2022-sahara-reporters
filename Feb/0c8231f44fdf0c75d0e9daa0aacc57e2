The Nigerian Army has said another 104 members of the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) and Boko Haram have surrendered to Nigerian troops. This was contained in a post shared on the Twitter handle of the Nigerian Army on Monday. File photo used to illustrate story. In the post, the Nigerian Army said the 104 terrorists consisted of their wives and other family members. The terrorists surrendered on Saturday to the troops of 25 Task Force Brigade Damboa, Borno State on Saturday, February 5. It reads, “ISWAP fighters and their families numbering 104 comprising 22 males, 27 females and 55 children surrendered to troops of 25 Task Force Brigade Damboa, Borno State on Saturday 5 February 2022." Some months ago, the news circle was dominated by reports of repeated surrenders of Boko Haram terrorists to the Nigerian military. In August 2021, the Nigerian Army gifted clothes and food items to over 1,000 Boko Haram and Islamic State West African Province fighters whom the military claimed had surrendered to troops in Borno State during a clearance operation. Since then, at least 18,000 Boko Haram fighters and their families have surrendered to the army following the death in May of their leader Abubakar Shekau. Shekau blew himself up to avoid capture during infighting with the rival Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) faction in his Sambisa Forest enclave.ISWAP split from Boko Haram in 2016 to become a dominant group in Nigeria with ties to the so-called Islamic State. Many Maiduguri residents fear jihadists are surrendering not out of remorse, but in desperation to escape ISWAP rivals who were executing Boko Haram militants for refusing to yield to the group.
