I am grateful to God for the strength, energy and good health that I am enjoying.“My message to the Yoruba people worldwide who are passionate for the country of their own is not to lose hope.“I am more than convinced that we are on our way to freedom. Our agitation is an idea whose time has come. We shall keep the struggle alive, and beyond the manipulation of the Nigerian government. “We won’t allow the Nigerian Government to criminalise our struggle. The Yoruba people worldwide are urged never to be deterred.” He added that, “Many Yoruba patriots worldwide planned to celebrate my birthday but I pleaded with them not to do so in honour of my son and one of the heroes of our struggle, Chief Sunday Adeyemo, fondly called Sunday Ighoho, by all of us.
