Our correspondent learnt that the police tagged the young man an internet fraudster, popularly called Yahoo boy.An eyewitness told SaharaReporters that the young man was on a motorbike when the police stopped him and asked for his identity card.A commercial motorcyclist who spoke with SaharaReporters said, "It happened around 9 am. One of our colleagues took the young man from Apata; he was going to Dugbe. When the police stopped him, he was asked to bring out his identity card but he told them he was a student."The police asked for his account balance. It was about N700,000 and they asked him to transfer it. After transferring it, they continued to beat him until the boy was unconscious. He was rushed to the hospital by the police themselves and he later died. That was why the youths are revolting. "I met them while beating the guy. I couldn't work again after the incident for fear of reprisal. The police have asked for backup from Iyaganku. That is why the police have taken over Apata area command."Efforts to reach the state police spokesperson, Adewale Osifeso, were not successful as he did not answer calls to his mobile line nor reply to a text message sent to him.
