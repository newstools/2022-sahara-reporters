The Supreme Court, on Friday, ruled that it is not the responsibility of the Nigerian government to provide funding for state judiciaries. This is even as the court dismissed a suit filed by the Attorney-Generals of the 36 states of the federation which argued that the federal government’s responsibility is to fund capital and recurrent expenditures of state high courts, Sharia court of appeal and customary court of appeal.
