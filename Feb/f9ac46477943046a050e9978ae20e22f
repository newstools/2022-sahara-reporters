The Police Service Commission has called for the immediate suspension of officers attached to the Intelligence Response Team (IRT) under the leadership of disgraced police chief, Abba Kyari. Also, the Commission has directed the Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba to suspend two other inspectors. SaharaReporters Media The suspended commander of the Intelligence Response Team (IRT) was on Monday declared wanted by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) for selling cocaine consignment seized by IRT operatives from drug barons at the Enugu airport in January this year. This came on the trail of his controversial involvement with self-confessed Internet fraudster, Ramon Abbas, popularly known as Hushpuppi. In July 2021, the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation revealed how Kyari allegedly collaborated with Hushpuppi to jail one of the latter’s associates after a dispute over a $1.1 million scam on a Qatari businessman. The FBI also alleged that the embattled social media celebrity sent money to Kyari via a third person’s bank account and hosted him in his Dubai apartment. Meanwhile, an earlier report had shown that the NDLEA's revelation shows that more senior police operatives and other security agents would be arrested following the detention of Kyari over drug-related offences. The latest scandal involving the suspended Kyari came to the fore on Monday, a few hours after the super cop was declared wanted by the NDLEA over his involvement in a 25 kilogrammes cocaine deal.
