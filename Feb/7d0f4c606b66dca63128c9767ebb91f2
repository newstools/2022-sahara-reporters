The African Action Congress (AAC) has declared its support for the electoral act amendment bill protest which will hold on Tuesday, February 22 in Abuja.This was contained in a statement issued on Monday by Femi Adeyeye, the National Publicity Secretary of the Party. According to the statement, the protests are necessary considering the abuse the electoral space has suffered under President Muhammadu Buhari administration.“From the deregistration of 74 political parties, some of whom would be at the Supreme Court on February 22, 2022, to the unjust, illegal, and immoral meddlesomeness in the internal democracy of political parties, as seen in the case of the AAC, the regime has shown total disregard to the rights of Nigerians to freely participate in the process that would determine who and what system leads them into the future they desire.”The party further noted that hitches in the electoral system are responsible for the apathy recorded at both the Lagos local government elections and FCT area council elections.“Even Nigerians living in the rural areas who have been dubbed “faithful voters” didn’t come out to exercise their franchise. It is worrisome that the people of Nigeria have lost trust in the system. We are deeply concerned as a political party.“However, it is unscientific to think people would participate in a process where their will and aspirations are not represented.“This is why we continue to protest vehemently the deregistration of political parties on the grounds stated by INEC; same as the undue interference of INEC in our party.”The party further said legal actions towards flushing out state-sponsored usurpers from the AAC has entered full throttle, noting that the case will continue at the Court of Appeal, Abuja Division, on Tuesday. “We are hopeful that justice, in the interest of democracy would be served on the matter,” the statement said.It added: “As it concerns the signing or otherwise of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2021, we as a party are not under any illusion that the “Oh Yes” men and women of the loan-approving and budget-padding centre called National Assembly would do what is right, however little, for the people. We have always maintained that the APC and PDP are incapable of doing what is right.“If that’s not the case, overriding the veto of the sleepy President who has withheld assent to the bill seven (7) different times, should not take a galactic year to happen.“It is so unfortunate that the Buhari regime would have to be forced to do a token, even at the twilight of its inglorious exit. What exactly is the regime afraid of?“This is why we are calling on Nigerians to mount serious pressure beyond the pressure to sign the electoral act amendment bill 2021. We must all bond at this time to make sure our electoral space is expanded, the Independent Electoral Commission as the umpire is devoid of officials with bias and partisanship, and that the amendment bill is signed into law, so that Nigerians can make electoral choices freely, fairly and faith in the system may then be incrementally built.“We call on Nigerians to troop out in their numbers at all protest venues on Tuesday, 22nd February 2022 and demand a free, fair and credible electoral system, moving forward.”
