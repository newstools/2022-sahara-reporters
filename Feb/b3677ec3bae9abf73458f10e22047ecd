Just after midnight, officers from the Corsicana Police Department responded to a report that Milazzo had killed his family members, police said Saturday. When police arrived at the residence, they found the bodies of an adult male and an adult female who had been fatally shot, New York Post reports. Two additional gunshot victims were found and airlifted to a Dallas area trauma center, police said.

They had also been shot and killed, according to police. A woman was also found with several gunshot wounds and was transported to a Dallas area trauma center. She was not identified by police and her condition wasn’t known early Sunday.Law enforcement was able to locate Milazzo by tracking his vehicle’s GPS system. Corsicana cops, the department’s SWAT team and Navarro County deputies found and approached Milazzo on a rural road after his vehicle’s engine had been remotely shut off by a monitoring service, cops said.As officers swarmed, they found Milazzo critically injured inside with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Matthew Branch, a medical doctor and member of the SWAT team, provided treatment at the scene, according to police.
