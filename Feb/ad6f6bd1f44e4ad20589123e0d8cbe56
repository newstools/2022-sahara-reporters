Members of the Zamfara State House of Assembly have impeached the Deputy Governor of the state, Mr Mahadi Gusau.  Mahadi was impeached during plenary on Wednesday shortly after the House received the report of the committee set up by the Chief Judge of the state, Justice Kulu Aliyu, to investigate the allegations of abuse of office, among others, levelled against him.  SaharaReporters reported that the Assembly had a few weeks ago taken steps to impeach the deputy governor.  Eighteen members of the assembly had voted in support of the impeachment which made Aliyu inaugurate the panel.  The deputy governor had refused to join Governor Bello Matawalle to defect to the All Progressives Congress (APC).  Mahadi, who is a son of a former Minister of Defence, Ali Gusau, argued that the Supreme Court awarded the electoral victory in 2019 to the PDP and not just its candidates.
