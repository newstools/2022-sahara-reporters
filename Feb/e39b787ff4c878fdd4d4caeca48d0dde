Suspended police chief, Abba Kyari, taken into the custody of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) on Monday will be extradited to the United States after his probe for an illicit drug deal top sources have confirmed. According to The Nation, the Federal Government had concluded plans with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Intelligence (FBI) to hand over the deputy commissioner of police, who is wanted for taking bribe from suspected celebrity internet fraudster, Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, alias Hushpuppi, from a $1.1million loot.  It was also learnt that the police authorities delayed action on Kyari for four days until the Presidency directed Inspector-General Baba Usman to release him to the NDLEA. Shortly before he was released to the anti-drug agency alongside four other police officers indicted for the same misdemeanour, the NDLEA had declared Kyari wanted after announcing his involvement with drugs and releasing a video of his attempt to bribe operatives to the public. Sources said President Muhammadu Buhari received a report on Kyari from the Chairman of the NDLEA, Gen. Buba Marwa.

Two drug suspects linked with the Kyari group are already in the agency’s custody. “The interrogation of the five police officers will begin on Tuesday (today) alongside the two drug traffickers in NDLEA’s net. “Both the traffickers and the police officers will have the opportunity to face detectives on how Kyari became an intermediary. “It is expected that this action may lead to the unearthing of the drug cartel in the country.”
