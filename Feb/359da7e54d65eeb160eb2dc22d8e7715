Terrorists, locally known as bandits, have taken over Suleja-Minna Road in Niger State.  SaharaReporters learnt that the bandits blocked the highway and attacked travellers on the road. This is the federal road that leads from Minna to the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.Passengers coming from Abuja heading to Minna are forced to make a U-turn or pull over while waiting for intervention of security operatives.No security operative has been there to confront the bandits, so motorists and passengers have been stuck, SaharaReporters learnt.
