A Senior Secondary School 2 student in Adamawa State has said he engaged in robbery to raise money to pay his tuition. The 23-year-old student, Abubakar Mohammed, attends Demsawo Government Secondary School in Yola, the state capital.  Mohammed allegedly broke into the home of one Maryam Jamilu at Wauru Jabbe in Yola South Local Government Area during the day, threatening to kill her with a knife. According to the state police command, the incident occurred on February 11. The police said Mohammed stole mobile phones valued at N74, 000, and N200 cash. SaharaReporters learnt that Maryam later spotted Mohammed outside and was able to identify him as the thief who had robbed her in her house. When arraigned at a Yola Magistrates Court, Mohammed confessed to having committed armed robbery but added that he did it to get money to pay his first and second terms’ school fees. He said since his father’s death, there has been no one to help him. The prosecutor, ASP Francis Audu, however, urged the court to remand the defendant at a correctional centre pending legal advice from the state director of public prosecutions.
