No fewer than 20 terrorists have been killed by the troops of Operation Thunder Strike, a formation of the Nigerian Air Force. The security operatives launched an offensive against the terrorists following a tip-off that they had planned to attack the Nigerian Defence Academy, Kaduna, Afaka.  The armed men riding on over 50 motorcycles, were seen on Thursday evening advancing towards the military institution, according to a report by PR Nigeria. Recall that in August 2021, the terrorists invaded the Afaka Barracks of the Nigerian Defence Academy, Kaduna State, killing a naval officer. The armed men were said to have also kidnapped two majors at the time while some others suffered gunshot injuries. However, in the recent attempt on Thursday, the attack was foiled as gunmen were intercepted following a tip-off on their movement through the military school’s general areas. The Nigerian Air Force helicopter gunships were said to have been dispatched to engage the criminals, who had taken off from Damari Village in Birnin Gwari Local Government Area of Kaduna State. The bandits were sighted in makeshift tents and motorcycles numbering about 50. A part of the report said, “On sighting the aircraft, the bandits started fleeing into the fringes of the forest. This brought about an objective and very decisive rain of hell from above on the miscreants as surviving bandits seen to be scampering for safety from the superior air presence were effectively mopped up. “Moreso as it is customary, feedback received on Friday after the operation from both the ground forces and local sources, revealed that the bandits were effectively disoriented and suffered a loss of about 20 bandits. “Also, their plans of harassing and shaming the Nigerian Defence Academy and the Government of the day was effectively thwarted.”
