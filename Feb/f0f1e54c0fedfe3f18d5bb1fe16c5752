Founder of the Niger Delta Peoples Volunteer Force, Mujahid Asari-Dokubo, has taken a swipe at Yoruba elders over their alleged support for the Indigenous People of Biafra and its leader, Nnamdi Kanu. Dokubo, during a Facebook live on Friday, queried why Yoruba leaders were encouraging some controversial tactics of IPOB and not adopting such in the South-West region.  He accused Yoruba leaders of ‘cheering IPOB members on to violence and destruction’ particularly with reference to the sit-at-home order allegedly enforced by members of the group while there was no lockdown in the South-West region to protest the continued detention of Yoruba Nation agitator, Sunday ‘Igboho’ Adeyemo. Like Kanu, Igboho is agitating for the disintegration of Nigeria and creation of a new nation. Both are currently in detention for their views in this regard. Igboho is being detained in Benin Republic by the government of the West African country after he was arrested at Cotonou airport, while trying to travel to Germany. Dokubo said, “Yoruba elders, why are you not telling Sunday Igboho and his supporters to destroy Lagos, destroy Osogbo, destroy Ibadan, destroy all the markets and business centres in South-West?’ Why are they not doing sit-at-home? Why are they not encouraging them (residents of South-West)? Their (Yoruba leaders) agenda is to destroy Igboland. “They are not telling their people to destroy but they are telling you (Igbo people) to destroy (your own). And Igbos are contributing money for you abroad. I’m so ashamed.”
