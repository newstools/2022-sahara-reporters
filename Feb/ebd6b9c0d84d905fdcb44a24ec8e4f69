A fire outbreak at an Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) camp in the Muna general area, in the Jere Local Government Area of Borno State has rendered many homeless.  The fire outbreak, which occurred on Friday, destroyed some shelters.  Witnesses say the fire started from a shelter and quickly spread to adjoining accommodation in the area.  It was learnt that no life was lost due to the incident but a few people sustained minor injuries while trying to put out the fire.  In November 2021, about 205 tents were burnt in the Muna camp.
