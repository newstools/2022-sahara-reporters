Some South-East women and supporters of the detained leader Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, thronged the court on Wednesday calling for the immediate release of the agitator.The women who were mostly middle-aged said Nnamdi Kanu had committed no crime and should be freed from the detention of the DSS. A woman perceived to be their leader said, “Free our son, he has committed no crime. This man lost his parents to this struggle. He's our saviour.”The women subsequently sat on the floor, wailing and mourning the detention of the IPOB leader while they rolled on the floor in their Isiagu attire.Meanwhile, there were also male supporters at the venue who alleged that Nnamdi Kanu was being detained for seeking the independence of the southeast region.One of them said, “They should allow us to go, you move according to your pace. We must go. Biafra must be free, whether they like it or not, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu must be free, that's what we're saying, give us our freedom. They should allow us to develop.”The embattled IPOB leader had arrived the courtroom on Wednesday as trial for terrorism charges continues.A 15-count terrorism charge was slammed on Nnamdi Kanu by the Nigerian Government.He, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges and asked the court to discharge and acquit him without standing trial because the charges were incurably defective and not worth being defended.
