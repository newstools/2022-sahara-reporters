Gunmen suspected to be Fulani herdsmen have reportedly invaded parts of Agatu Local Government Area of Benue State, destroying farmlands and displacing thousands of persons. The Commissioner for Information, Culture and Tourism, Michael Inalegwu disclosed this on Tuesday when the new Och’Idoma, Dr John Odogbo Elaigwu, led other traditional rulers and stakeholders from Agatu LGA on a thank-you visit to Governor Samuel Ortom in Makurdi.

Google According to the Commissioner whose elder brother was recently murdered by gunmen, the armed herders invaded Agatu with their cattle in their numbers chasing the locals from their homes. He said, “Right from Egba to Odugbeho and Okokolo communities the people have deserted their homes and farms because the armed Fulani herders have once again invaded these communities in their thousands. “As at yesterday, nobody could go to the farm. The people left their farm produce, their yam, genuine corn, seedlings at the mercy of the Fulani people and their cattle. “Though there are soldiers and security personnel in Agatu who are prepared to move into the besieged communities, the villages are not easily accessible and the security personnel are also not enough.” Inalegwu called for the opening up of more roads in the area to enable soldiers and other security personnel easy access to maintain law and order in the communities. Speaking, the Och’Idoma urged all Idoma sons and daughters to put their differences behind and work for the development of Idoma land. The monarch said, “I prayed that God should use me to unite Idoma people. I urge all Idoma sons and daughters to come together, put their differences behind and work together because this is a new dawn and I believe the Almighty God is for us.”
