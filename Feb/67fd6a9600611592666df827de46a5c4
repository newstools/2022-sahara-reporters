The Ooni of Ife, Yoruba’s foremost traditional ruler, Adeyeye Ogunwusi, has ordered a restriction of movement in Ile-Ife, Osun State, from 11pm to 5am over incessant criminal activities. The development was reported to have forced the traditional council members and some local security to keep vigil in some areas through the night, last Friday.  The Ooni, in a statement, through the Lowa of Ife, Abraham Ademola, had ordered restriction of movement in the town since Saturday night. “The Imperial Majesty, Oba Ogunwusi, has ordered lockdown from 11pm to 5am in Ife township from today (Saturday). No vigil, no night party, night prayers in all churches and mosques, among others. “This is because robbers and bandits’ presence in Ile-Ife is on high which is causing the community sleepless nights. “The police with the local securities are now in the community to ensure security. Anyone caught within these hours will be treated as such. The restriction is till further notice.” But the Secretary to the Osun State Government, Wole Oyebamiji, said in a statement that there is no restriction of movement in any part of the state. He, however, cautioned residents to avoid reckless movements especially at odd hours of the day. “The Government of the State of Osun wishes to inform the public that there is no curfew of any nature in any part of the state,” the statement read. “The government is assuring citizens that Osun remains safe regardless of the activities of a few criminal elements. This government has never and will not fold its hands while a few criminal elements decide to violate the rights of other citizens. “Those found culpable of disrupting the peace of Osun will face the full weight of the law if apprehended. Anyone who has found delight in being a trouble maker has the option of relocating elsewhere if they cannot do without fomenting trouble.”
