Militants from the Islamic State-backed faction of Boko Haram, the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), formerly known as Jamā'at Ahl as-Sunnah lid-Da'wah wa'l-Jihād, have taken over a military base located in Gamboru Ngala, Borno State. SaharaReporters gathered that the insurgents on gun trucks attacked the base on Saturday night, exchanging firepower with Nigerian troops stationed in the community. File photo used to illustrate story According to a military source, the gunmen came in different groups and could not be counted. The source added that “some Nigerian soldiers were killed while others fled into the bush”. It was learnt that the insurgents also “burnt some buildings and vehicles in the military base”. Since the death of JAS leader, Abubakar Shekau, ISWAP has been consolidating its grip in locations around Lake Chad. Last year, it appointed Wali Sani Shuwaram, a 45-year-old as the new Leader (Wali) of ISWAP in Lake Chad. The sect’s membership has swollen with the defection of hundreds of Boko Haram fighters under Shekau. Meanwhile, the Nigerian Army on its Twitter page on Monday announced success in its fight against insurgency around Mandara mountains along the northern part of the Nigeria-Cameroon border. “Based on intelligence report, today troops of 144 Battalion Madagali-Adamawa State in conjunction with Civilian JTF laid an ambush on withdrawing ISWAP/Boko Haram Terrorists after a superiority clash between the terror groups. Scores of terrorists were neutralized at Mandara mountains,” it said.
