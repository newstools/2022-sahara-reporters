The judge, who expressed displeasure over the development warned the EFCC to sit up and prosecute the case diligently without wasting the time of the court.The former minister was arraigned on 12 counts bordering on the use of false documents, the use of fabricated evidence, fabricating evidence, among others. One of the counts reads, "That you, Femi Fani-Kayode, on or about the 11th day of October 2021 in Lagos, within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court, by fraudulent representation procured one Dr. Ogieva Oziegbe to execute a document titled: Medical report on Olufemi Fani-Kayode 60 years/male/HOSP. NO. 00345 dated 11/10/2021 and procured the same to have been issued by Kubwa General Hospital."According to the anti-graft agency, the procuring and execution of documents by false pretence is contrary to section 369 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State 2015.He, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge.At the resumed hearing of the matter on Friday, the judge asked the EFCC counsel, Bilikisu Buhari about the update on the amended charge she promised to file.In her response, she said the commission had yet to take further action on the amended charge.Subsequently, the judge also asked the defence counsel, Wale Balogun if they have applied to obtain the proof of evidence.The lawyer in his response said they are waiting for the prosecutor to amend the charges first.The judge expressed his displeasure about the development stating that if the defence had applied and obtained the proof of evidence, she would have ordered the EFCC to open its case.
