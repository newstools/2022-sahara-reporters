An Abuja-based human rights lawyer, Pelumi Olajengbesi, has urged the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, to immediately hand over suspended Head of the Intelligence Response Team, DCP Abba Kyari, to the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency to prove his innocence.Olajengbesi made this known in a statement on Monday shortly after the NDLEA declared Kyari wanted over alleged drug links. He said, “The IGP must immediately order the arrest of Abba Kyari and hand him over to the NDLEA at a public press conference if truly the police do not shield bad eggs.“The IGP must prove that he is not backing Abba Kyari in his alleged atrocious crimes exposed in the public glare in the last one year.”NDLEA spokesperson, Femi Babafemi, at a press briefing in Abuja on Monday, had chronicled how Kyari belonged to a drug cartel that operates the Brazil-Ethiopia-Nigeria illicit drug pipeline.The anti-drugs agency said Kyari contacted one of its officers in Abuja and struck a deal to secure the release of a total of 25kg seized cocaine.Reacting, the human rights lawyer recalled how Kyari was indicted in 2021 by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States for his alleged role in a $1million scam allegedly perpetrated by alleged international Internet fraudster Ramon Abbas, aka, Hushpuppi and five others.Olajengbesi added, “Justice must be served in the case of Abba Kyari and it must be served now to deter the bad eggs amongst the security agents colluding with drug barons and internet fraudsters to perpetrate heinous crimes and tarnish the image of the Force.“The Police and the Nigerian Government have no excuse not to arrest Abba Kyari now that a government agency has found him culpable of heavy crimes. There must be no cover ups, no matter whose ox is gored.”
