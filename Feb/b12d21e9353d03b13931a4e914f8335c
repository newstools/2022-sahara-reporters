Fire has gutted a section of the Kaduna residence of renowned Islamic scholar, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi. This was made known in a post on his official Facebook page on Saturday. Sheikh Ahmad Gumi According to Gumi, the fire started from a lab in the Islamic school where some students were reciting the Quran. He stated that the affected students will be relocated to another classroom in the facility but no life was lost in the inferno. He said, “We thank Allah for his unlimited mercies. The fire started from the Physics lab and we are surprised because there's even no electric power supply. We were using the generator and suddenly fire started coming out from the lab but along the line, we can see it is only limited to upstairs. “We are going to relocate students that are affected to another classroom somewhere so they can continue their lesson. Just some few students memorising the Quran, just few, they're not up to 10.”
