Militants from the Islamic State-backed faction of Boko Haram, the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), formerly known as Jamā'at Ahl as-Sunnah lid-Da'wah wa'l-Jihād on Monday mounted roadblocks in some parts of Borno State. Areas, where the checkpoints were mounted by the terror group, include Mile 40, along Maiduguri/Gajaram road and Wajiroko, along Damboa/Biu road.  Sources said the insurgents were on the highways “checking on travellers' identity cards to fish out security operatives travelling in mufti.” “They were also issuing tax receipts to defaulters,” another source confirmed. SaharaReporters had in several reports in 2021 reported how ISWAP had been taxing residents of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe State.
