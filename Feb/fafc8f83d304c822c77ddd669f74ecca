Investigation into circumstances that led to the death of a student of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife, Miss Ajibola Heritage Ayomikun has been taken over by the Criminal Investigation Department of the Osun State Command of the Nigeria Police Force.It was learnt that the owner of the Private Hostel, Bver, where the student died had not responded to a query sent by the management of the University. A 200-level student of the department of Linguistics and African Languages, Heritage Ajibola, reportedly died on Wednesday.Ms Ajibola had fallen into an improperly kept soak-away at a private hostel within the university community. This led to her death.The university management, while confirming Miss Ajibola’s death, said as soon as it got the information, the emergency response team including its fire fighters and those from the Osun State Government, among others, were mobilised to the scene.The university’s public relations officer, Abiodun Olarewaju, said the student was confirmed dead at the institution’s teaching hospital, where she was rushed to after a joint effort to retrieve her from the soak-away by the firefighters.The statement by Mr Olarewaju reads in part, “The university management is saddened by this unfortunate incident. The Vice Chancellor, Professor Eyitope Ogunbodede, who led his management team to the scene, sympathised with the students and commiserated with the parents of the deceased.“Professor Ogunbodede, who described the incident as tragic and unacceptable, promised to critically look into the circumstances that led to the student’s death and mete out appropriate sanctions against those involved or whoever is found culpable.“The Vice Chancellor, therefore, appealed to the students to remain calm and law abiding as the police, who have been briefed, are also investigating.”
