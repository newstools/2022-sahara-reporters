He said, “The ultimate thing is that the youths should try to get their PVC. After all, it’s not just these two political parties that we have. "We have the opportunity to turn things around. And it’s possible that things will turn around in favour of the Nigerian youths. “Everybody should get their PVC. After a few weeks, we can make a decision. Already, I’m embarking on consultations with our counterparts across the country. “Our decision on who to support will depend on who they pick as their running mates. We want a candidate that will have the younger generation at heart and who they pick as their running mates will tell us more about who they are," he added. Recall that the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, had given Friday June 17, 2022, as a deadline for political parties to send the names of their Presidential candidates and running mates.
