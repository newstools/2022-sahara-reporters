We watched you all through our childhood. All these as an actor, we hear every day. I offered all I had on me and one of them dragged me by my agbada and demanded an amount I couldn’t pay.“I asked him to leave me and he said, “Do your worse” the rest is a story. Please stop harassing actors or entertainers; do you pay anyone for doing your job? No it’s our job too. Accept all we offer when we do. Remember, once a boxer always a boxer."
