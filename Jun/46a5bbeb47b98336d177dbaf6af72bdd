Some officers of the Nigerian Air Force studying at the Air Force Institute of Technology in Kaduna State have complained that they have not received their Ration Cost Allowance (RCA) in the last seven months.According to the Manual of Financial Administration of Armed Forces of Nigerian (2017), military students under Nigerian Air Force sponsorship are entitled to RCA daily. Some of the personnel told SaharaReporters that the situation was causing them hunger and depleting their morale.They claimed that the development demonstrates their superiors’ insensitivity to their enormous sacrifices for the country.“In 2021, we were given admission for NAF sponsored course in Airfoce Institute of Technology, Kaduna. To run different regular courses such HND Aircraft Engineering Technology, Explosive Ordinance Technology, Mechanical Engineering, Purchasing and Supply and ND aircraft engineering technology,” one of the aggrieved personnel told SaharaReporters.“As Military student under NAF sponsorship we are entitled Ration Cost Allowance (RCA) as contained Manual of Financial Administration of Armed Forces of Nigerian 2017. We are entitled to RCA of ₦1200 daily since we we are not being feed as our colleagues running military course.“We resume our course June 2021 by October 2021, we received ₦159,000 for the period we have spent from June to October. According to NAF Headquarters, we are to receive RCA every quarter. From November 2021 to now June 2022 we are yet to receive our RCA.“We have to feed from our salary and run other stuff. It’s not easy especially for people who come from unit outside Kaduna and have family. NAF HQ keeps requesting for our list, yet no result.“Before NAF day celebration in May, we got the information that Chief of Air Staff specifically requested for our list for RCA, they said he approved it but uptill this moment, nothing has been paid to us.”
