Nollywood actress, Funke Akindele’s husband, Abdulrasheed Bello, also known as JJC Skillz has announced his separation from the popular actress. In a post on his Instagram handle on Thursday, Bello said for the past 3 months, he had nothing to do with the actress after she requested that he should move out of their apartment. He revealed that for the past two years, the relationship had been in turmoil noting that he had made efforts to fix it but 'is now beyond repair'. According to him, the couple has yet to resolve other issues including the custody of their children and other business interests. His post reads, “Dear Friends and family I need to let you know that Funke and I have separated. While it lasted we shared a lot of things together and have created 2 beautiful children. “The last two years have been extremely difficult for us. I know I have tried my best to fix things but I believe it is beyond repair now. 3 months ago and at Funke's insistence I moved out of the house and apart from AMVCA, I have not been able to get Funke to sit down in an amicable manner to discuss the future of our relationship. “I'm making this announcement so that the public is clear that we both are pursuing separate lives. We still have issues that need to be addressed such as the custody and wellbeing of our children which is paramount as well as business interests which need to be disentangled but I have no doubt that these will be resolved one way or the other.”
