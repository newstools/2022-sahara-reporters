President Muhammadu Buhari is currently holding a closed-door meeting with governors of the All Progressives Congress, APC, from the north at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. This comes amid preparations for the party’s convention to elect its presidential candidate for the 2023 general elections.  Although President Buhari has maintained his position on the consensus arrangement, there has not been any agreement among the 23 presidential aspirants. The governors in attendance are Chairman of Progressive Governors Forum and governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu, chairman of Northern governors Forum and governors of Plateau State, Simeon Lalong, Abubakar Baduru (Jigawa) and Babagana Zulum (Borno). Others are; Aminu Bello Masari (Katsina), Abdullahi Sule (Nasarawa), Bello Matawale (Zamfara), Mallam Nasir el-Rufai (Kaduna), Abdullahi Ganduje (Kano), Yahaya Inuwa (Gombe), Abubakar Bello (Niger), and the Yobe State governor, Mai Mala Buni. The meeting with the APC governors from the north is the fourth parley in his effort to ensure that the party presents a consensus candidate so as to reduce acrimony that may arise at the end of the convention.
