One of the abducted passengers of the Abuja-Kaduna bound train, who were kidnapped by terrorists on March 28, 2022, has been shot by the gunmen.The victim, identified as Mohammed Al’Amin, was said to have been shot during a “friendly exchange of fire at the forest between the terrorists guarding the victims and preventing them from possible escape.” Illustration



Malam Tukur Mamu, the lead mediator who had earlier facilitated the release of 11 other victims with the support of other stakeholders disclosed this on Wednesday.He said, “Even though such an incidence that resulted in the shooting can happen, it could also be an intentional act from them for the purpose of sending a message. Killing of their victims is something we know they can do.”They have threatened to do that before. Government must be prepared to take full responsibility if they didn’t act fast. There has been communication constantly but government is yet to take a decision. I know what is in this crisis and that is why I keep emphasising that President Muhammadu Buhari must be prepared to take painful decisions, painful compromises if they are really committed to securing these innocent victims alive.“With what we have succeeded in doing, the windows and opportunity we opened which there’s none hitherto, the government has the power to bring this to an end within three to four days. I assure them we can do it with their support and cooperation, and if it didn’t happen; as long as the government does the needful, I will agree and accept to take full responsibility.”“Cases of emergency such as this don’t require unnecessary bureaucracy. I can confirm to you that the said passenger has been shot.”
