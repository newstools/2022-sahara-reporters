The presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, has lambasted Nigerian politicians, describing some of them as lunatics that have taken over the asylum.  Obi spoke on Sunday at the Men of Valour conference with the theme: “Navigating the corridors of power, the church, and the politics,” organised by the Revival House of International Church (RHOGIC), Abuja.  According to Obi, most of the nation's politicians have no reason to be in the corridors of power.  The Anambra former Governor said: “We can’t allow this gangsterism to continue, Nigerians should take back their country. 70 percent of those who are in politics today should not have any reason to be there. I have said it, politics in Nigeria is a case where lunatics have taken over the asylum.  “This is the only country where the worst is leading. I was a trader and gradually entered into politics. When you take far more than you need, you are sick.  “How do you explain that one person took N80 billion, it is not greed, it is sickness. When you take one billion that is greed, but when you take N80 billion that is sickness. Mad people have taken over our politics. If we get young people with the competence and capacity to be there, things will change.”  Obi, while speaking on whether a third force could take power from the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), said the people will decide.  Regarding the 2023 general elections, Obi said prayers alone could not salvage the country.  “We have prayed enough; it is time to act. With these people in power? You can pray from now until any time, they won’t go until you chase them out. So, it is time to act, not just pray. It is time for us to close the church and deal with these people,” he said.  Obi also urged the youths not to make a profession out of politics.
