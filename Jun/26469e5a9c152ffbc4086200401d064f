There is tension in Kubwa, a suburb of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja as residents on Monday found the butchered body of a yet-to-be-identified lady by a river in PW area, near Deeper Life Church. It was believed to have been dumped there by suspected ritualists  The incident attracted a large crowd as residents thronged the location to catch a glimpse of the butchered and decapitated body of the lady. When SaharaReporters visited the scene, a beheaded corpse of a naked woman packed inside two bags was seen beside the river. The body parts were cut into pieces with blood stains on the bags.  An eyewitness who spoke on condition of anonymity told our correspondent that the corpse was discovered early Monday morning following the stench coming from the spot.  He said the body might have been dumped by suspected ritualists in the night.  He said, "We saw the body this morning because of the odour that was coming from the river and when people moved closer, they found two bags with the body parts cut into pieces. We don't know who dumped the body there but this looks like a ritual killing. “One of the ritualists may have dumped her here in the night and zoomed off."  At the time of filing this report, some policemen from Kubwa Divisional Police station were sighted at the scene taking photographs of the corpse while the crowd lamented the tragedy.  Efforts to reach the FCT police spokesperson, Josephine Adeh for a reaction were not successful.  Meanwhile, the river which is located in the centre of Kubwa where the incident occurred, is being used as a refuse dump for trash movers, popularly known as Bolar, thereby making it difficult for the residents to identify the perpetrators.
