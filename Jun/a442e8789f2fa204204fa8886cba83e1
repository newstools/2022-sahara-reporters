The Rivers State Governor and former presidential aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party PDP, Nyesom Wike, will in France reportedly meet with the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu. This was disclosed by the Special Adviser to Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu On Environment and Water Resources, Joe Igbokwe, on Wednesday on his social media platforms.  Igbokwe said, “While they are on Social Media abusing everybody, Gov Wike goes to France to meet Asiwaju. Abuse, calling names, hate and bigotry are no strategy. “They hated and abused PMB since 2015 and now they have transferred the aggression to Asiwaju. We wait and see.” Former vice-president and serial presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, had emerged as the presidential candidate of the opposition party, the PDP. Atiku emerged as a candidate at the end of the presidential primary after polling 371 votes. He defeated Nyesom Wike, who scored 237 votes. Atiku however ignored Wike when he chose Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State as a running mate. Hence, his decision had degenerated into an internal crisis in the PDP. One of Wike’s associates and friends, Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State, on Tuesday said he was still praying and fasting to know if God wanted him to support Atiku or not. SaharaReporters also reported that the former Governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose, made it clear that he was for Southern presidency or nothing, which was an indication that he would not be supporting Atiku for the presidency.
