A resident of Ogun State who simply identified himself as John has narrated how he was attacked in his house in police barracks on Wednesday night by three armed robbers. His house is located in C. A. C, Oke Ihinrere Area Command, Balufon, Ogun State.  John, a tenant at the police barracks, disclosed this via a series of tweets, explaining that three men armed with machetes came to his house to rob him of his belongings. He said the assailants also threatened to kill him because he saw their faces. He further alleged that this gave him the courage to attack them in self-defence, saying he brought down one of the robbers while the others escaped.
