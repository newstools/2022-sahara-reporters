The Northern Elders Forum has criticised President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration over the negligence of public office holders amid the many challenges confronting the nation.  In a tweet on Wednesday, the group's spokesperson, Hakeem Baba-Ahmed lambasted the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige for seeking to contest the presidency without proffering solutions to the prolonged strike action embarked upon by members of the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU.  Baba-Ahmed also lambasted the former minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi for abandoning his duty in search of a presidential ticket. Amaechi contested for the presidential ticket of the APC shortly after a terrorist attack on a Kaduna-bound train on March 29, 2022, in which at least eight persons were killed and several passengers were kidnapped. He tweeted: “Ngige was going to leave the ASUU strike and students at home to run for the Presidency of Nigeria.  Ngige was going to leave the ASUU strike and students at home to run for the Presidency of Nigeria.Rotimi Amaechi left a stalled train service and passengers with kidnappers to ask us to make him President of Nigeria.President Buhari does not care who runs a country in a mess.  “Rotimi Amaechi left a stalled train service and passengers with kidnappers to ask us to make him President of Nigeria.
