Rubén de Jesús Valdez Díaz, a mayor of the state of Chiapas, in southern Mexico, has been shot to death by gunmen, the regional prosecutor’s office reported.  Valdez who is also the President of the municipality of Teopisca, was attacked on Wednesday while leaving his house in a vehicle by men mounted on a motorcycle.  The prosecution, according to a report by Canadian News, has announced the opening of an investigation to find the assailants.  Valdez was elected municipal president in the regional elections on June 6, 2021.  According to eyewitness accounts, after the crime, an armed group broke into the town and searched some homes. Business activity and school classes were suspended.  The homicide occurred two weeks after videos circulated showing another squad, presumably from drug trafficking, touring the town.  His assassination comes a few weeks after the death of Aguililla Mayor Cesar Valencia, in the state of Michoacán (west). He was shot on March 11 in the town hard hit by suspected drug cartels.
