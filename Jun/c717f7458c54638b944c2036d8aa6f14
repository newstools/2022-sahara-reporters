Some members of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) have lamented the alleged refusal of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to recognise Chief Edozie Njoku’s faction despite a court judgement.  They wondered why it is taking INEC so long to comply with the corrected judgement, saying the commission promptly complied with the October 14, 2020 judgment of the Supreme Court which contained the mistake.  Chekwas Okorie and Victor Oye have been laying claims to the leadership of the party ahead of the 2023 general elections.  “This is impunity. 2023 may not hold, if INEC cannot respect Supreme Court Judgement,” an APGA member said.  Meanwhile, Njoku had written the commission to recognise him as the authentic Chairman of the party.  The founding National Chairman of the party in a letter by his lawyer G.E. Ezeuko (SAN) based his argument on a subsisting Supreme Court judgement which he said sacked Victor Oye.  “Our clients in a letter dated 29th June notified the Commission of the Supreme Court’s recognition of Chief Edozie Njoku as the National Chairman of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA),” the letter read.  “The said letter of 29th June, 2022 is herein annexed to this letter. Sequel to our clients’ letter dated May 10, 2022 on the above subject matter and in furtherance to the Supreme Court correction on the Judgement of October 14, 2021; Our clients have attached to their letter of 29th, June 2022 to the commission the judgement of Hon. Justice Mohammed Lawal Garba in the Suit No. SC/CV/687/2021 and Hon. Justice Mary Peter-Odili, in which important remarks were made by the two Justices.”
