Some workers in the Code of Conduct Tribunal, Abuja, have accused its chairman, Danladi Umar, of fraud, corruption, nepotism and marginalisation.The chairman was also accused of awarding fraudulent contracts to friends without recourse to procedure and due process. Danladi Umar



Speaking to SaharaReporters, one of the workers added that Umar had drained the finances of the agency without any significant project to match the billions of naira allocated to it annually.He added that annual trainings for staff had been blocked by the Tribunal Chairman.The source also accused Umar of turning the Jabi headquarters of the agency in Abuja to a hotel by allegedly bringing different women to sleep with him in the office overnight.“What is happening in CCT is unprecedented; we have been suffering under Umar for the past 10 years. He recently took things to another level of contract inflation and squandering of the resources of the tribunal at the detriment of the smooth operations of the agency and its workers. The level of corruption is mind-boggling,” the worker told SaharaReporters.“With the backing of (the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice) Abubakar Malami, he has turned the tribunal to his personal estate. We no more go for training. He has a bed in his office and now brings different women to spend the night with him.“President Buhari and the National Assembly members should help us, this is a man who has no respect for any workers, what he did to a security man at a popular plaza in Abuja is small to what he does to workers here. “Anytime the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission wants to investigate him, the AGF Malami would ask them not to; more so, some whistleblowers were recently sacked over Umar’s issues.”Another worker said, “The situation has gone so bad to the extent that he now brings women to the office to sleep with. This is because he can no longer afford hotel bills as he is highly indebted to most hotels in Abuja.“The suffering is too much. A visit to the Tribunal premises will speak volume from the exterior to the interior part of the building.”On March 29, 2021, Umar came into the limelight in recent times when he publicly assaulted one Clement Sargwak, a security guard at Banex Plaza in Wuse 2, Abuja.In a five-minute viral video clip, he was seen slapping and kicking the security guard after an altercation ensued between them over a parking space on the premises of the plaza.The victim, bruised on the lip he was attacked by Umar after he approached him for parking wrongly.He subsequently went to court to challenge the powers of the Senate to investigate him in an alleged assault against the security guard.
