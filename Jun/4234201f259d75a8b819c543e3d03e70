The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have been fingered in vote-buying in the ongoing Ekiti State governorship election.At Polling Unit 009, Oisa Alada Hall, Ward 02, Okeruku in the Ikere Local Government Area, inside a house located behind the Oisa Alada Hall, men and women including elderly people were seen rushing in and out with their Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs) to receive payment for their votes. An election observer told SaharaReporters that before going inside, a slender woman putting on a black round neck t-shirt collected their PVCs and took them in before permitting them to go in.Confirming the vote buying to the observer, some of the beneficiaries who refused to disclose their identities said that they were given the sum of N7,000 each by APC members inside the house.Similarly, Prof. Kolapo Olusola-Eleka, the former Deputy Governor to the former Governor Ayodele Fayose, of the PDP, was caught on camera beside a house along the road leading to a polling unit located close to the palace of Ogoga Ikere Kingdom.The former deputy governor was seen, directing a man who carried a backpack filled with money to give some security officials including the police who surrounded him in a circular form, some persons, an unconfirmed amount of money.According to an observer who made the information available to SaharaReporters, the security personnel who left their duty post at Oisa Alada Hall, Polling Unit 009, Ward 2 Okeruke, and ran after Olusola-Eleka when he passed by them with some thugs, later got some amount of money and shared among themselves.
