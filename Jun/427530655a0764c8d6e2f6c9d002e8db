The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has received another batch of 131 stranded Nigerian returnees from Libya.The stranded migrants arrived at the Cargo Wing of theMurtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos on Tuesday at about 7:20pm. The NEMA’s acting Coordinator of the Lagos Territorial Office, Mr Ibrahim Farinloye, who confirmed the development noted that they were brought in a Boeing 737-800 Al Buraq Air with registration number 5A-DMG.He asserted that the returnees were brought back to the country by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) through a voluntary repatriation programme.According to Farinloye, the programme was meant for the distressed Nigerians who had left the country to seek greener pastures in various European countries but could not afford to return when their journey became frustrated."The returnees are 31 male adults, 72 female adults, 11 boys, six girls, four female infants and seven male infants were brought back to the country."The IOM has so far brought 1,052 Nigerians from Libya this year. I enjoin the returnees to turn a new leaf by looking for opportunities in the country which are enough for everyone to achieve their desired goals," he said.He, however, appealed to the returnees to avoid vices that they might have been exposed to in the country of their departure.The returnees were received by NEMA, along with other sister agencies such as Immigration Service, Refugee Commission, Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) and the Nigerian Police.
