The presidential candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party, Rabiu Kwankwaso has urged the Nigerian Government to do more to secure the lives and property of citizens.  The former Kano state governor gave the advice on Wednesday when paid condolence visits to the palaces of the Olowo of Owo, Oba Gbadegesin Ogunoye III as well as the Olijebu of Ijebu-Owo, Oba Kofoworola Ojomo, in Ondo State over the recent terror attack on a Catholic church in the town.  SaharaReporters had reported how gunmen suspected to be Islamic terrorists invaded St Francis Xavier Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo State during the Solemnity of Pentecost Sunday celebration and massacred worshippers.  At least 40 worshippers have been confirmed killed while several others were injured. So many people both within and outside Nigeria have condemned the unwarranted attack on the place of worship.  The United Kingdom has described the massacre as atrocious and asked the government of President Muhammadu Buhari to do everything to arrest the perpetrators and ensure they are brought to justice.  Kwankwaso is one of several dignitaries who have visited Ondo State to show solidarity and console the victims’ families and the people of the state.
