The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and the Ohaneze Ndigbo have condemned the decision of the Federal High Court in Abuja to dismiss the fresh bail application by IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu.Kanu, who is currently facing seven-count, had in the application he filed through his team of lawyers led by Mike Ozekhome (SAN), challenged the revocation of the bail the court earlier granted to him. The IPOB leader also prayed the court to set aside the order it made on March 28, 2019, which not only issued a bench warrant for his arrest, but also gave the Federal Government the nod to try him in absentia.But Justice Binta Nyako rejected the application in her ruling and adjourned the trial till November 24.Reacting to the development, IPOB’s spokesman, Emma Powerful, said the group was not surprised, having seen the outcome through the President Muhammadu Buhari's body language and utterances.Speaking with PUNCH, Powerful said, “Buhari’s recent statement in Kigali, Rwanda was a testament that he has lost focus because he said he won’t interfere in the judicial process on Nnamdi Kanu, but was talking with both sides of his mouth.“IPOB understands the body language of Buhari and his Federal Government that they will influence Justice Binta Nyako to drop bail applications for Nnamdi Kanu’s freedom.“But we are ready to wait for them. We want to use this medium to inform humanity, particularly Biafrans to stay calm and that victory must come to us.”On his part, Damian Okeke-Ogene, the secretary for South-East Zone of Ohanaeze, Chief Damian Okeke-Ogene, also attributed the court’s verdict to Buhari’s statement.In an interview, he said, “If you assess the President’s comments and utterances before today’s court sitting, you will understand that he was not interested in releasing the young man because he knows that doing so will bring happiness to the people of the South-East, who are longing for his release.“Although, the court has adjourned the matter, Buhari’s recent utterances in the build-up to the court sitting greatly influenced the decision of the court and the President knows that keeping Kanu means that the insecurity in the South-East will continue because the people see him as their idol and they want him released.”
