Also, 28 live ammunition, a locally made pistol and a military camouflage were transferred to the Nigerian police, along with the suspects in view of inter-agency cooperation and synergy. "On the prosecution of drug suspects in court, the command performed creditably as 104 male drug offenders were sentenced to various terms of imprisonment, ranging from lowest sentence of six months to the highest sentence of four years without an option of fine in the period under review." "Also in our custody for prosecution is the arrest of a notorious drug baron in Hong arrested with 57 compressed blocks of Cannabis Sativa, concealed in the boot of his Ash coloured Toyota Corolla car on the 16 June, 2022. "The suspect, Abdullahi Musa, aka Yerima Uding, was fingered as the mastermind of the mob attack in Hong on October 6, 2020 that led to the burning and death of an NDLEA operative and another officer was brutally beaten to stupor and had since been bedridden, leading to his permanent incapacitation", he said. Agboalu urged journalists as critical stakeholders, to play their role by sharing real facts on drugs situation, health risks, emphasising the negative effects of drug abuse on the individual, family, community, the economy, while de-emphasizing the financial gains of trafficking in drugs.
