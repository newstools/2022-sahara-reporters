One of the opposition parties, the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), will today hold its presidential primary election at the Moshood Abiola Stadium, Abuja for the 2023 general elections.The party’s National Publicity Secretary, Dr. Agbo Major, made this known during a press briefing at its national secretariat in Abuja. Agbo said the defection of many top members of the ruling All Progressives Congress and the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) was good for the party even as the party was determined to produce the next president of Nigeria in 2023.Agbo called on Nigerians who are of voting age to get their voters’ cards ready in order to exercise their civic rights and vote for whoever the party would present as its flagbearer.According to the NNPP’s spokesperson, leaders of the party at all levels have been working together to draft workable plans of providing solutions to the challenges facing Nigeria and move the country forward.He said that “In continuation of various high level strategic meetings the Special National Convention (Presidential Primary) of the party will hold on Wednesday 8th June, 2022 at the Velodrome, MKO Abiola Stadium, Abuja.”Agbo noted that they are expecting a total of 774 delegates as one delegate is expected to come from each of the 774 local government areas in the country.He maintained that the NNPP is working hard to present credible candidates who will meet the expectations of Nigerians, win the 2023 general elections and reposition the country.He advised Nigerians not to sell their votes for whatever reasons “As witnessed in some political parties’ primaries where delegates mortgaged their conscience and voted for the highest bidder thus denying the electorate the choice of credible candidates.”
