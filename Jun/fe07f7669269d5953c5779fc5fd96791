An auto accident has killed three persons along the East/West Road near Opokuma junction. The deceased persons were burnt beyond recognition while three others sustained first-degree burns in the ghastly motor accident that occurred on Monday evening. File photo used to illustrate story. A Police Constable survived with minor injuries. The accident led to gridlock along the East/West Road. It was gathered that two cars, a Toyota Camry with registration number LS 529 KY and a Mazda 323 with registration number GBB 532 XA, had a head-on collision which resulted in an explosion. According to eyewitnesses, the Toyota Camry car was loaded with petroleum products, which were believed to have caused the heavy explosion. It was gathered that two men and one woman were killed and burnt beyond recognition. Three others however survived. An officer of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in the state confirmed that the​injured victims were taken to a hospital in Yenagoa for treatment. "The two cars were burnt​ and the victims in the Mazda were burnt beyond recognition as the Camry was loaded with adulterated Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) which sparked the fire. The SO KOLGA with the assistance of other motorists cleared the obstruction on the road for free flow of traffic," he said.  The FRSC, however, blamed speeding and loss of control for the fatal accident.  Also confirming the incident, the spokesman for the state police command, Asinim Butswat, said though the details of the accident were not immediately available, "three persons were burnt to death and three sustained first-degree burns”. “Three others were injured; a Police Constable was also injured," he added.
