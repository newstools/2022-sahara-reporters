Nigerians in the United Kingdom under the umbrella of the Central Association of Nigerians in the UK (CANUK) have condemned in strong terms, the heinous massacre of worshippers at St. Francis Catholic Church, Owo in Ondo State on Sunday, where many people were killed and scores injured by armed terrorists. The group in a statement jointly signed by its Publicity Secretary and Assistant Publicity Secretary, Princess Moradeun Adedoyin-Solarin and Mohammed Yiosese respectively, on Tuesday, June 7, while commiserating with the families affected by the incident, called on the Nigerian government and all Nigerian leaders to tighten security in the country and do more to ensure the safety of the lives of all Nigerians.  Describing it as ‘unprovoked carnage’, CANUK also called for the immediate arrest and prosecution of the perpetrators of the killing. The group said, “The Central Association of Nigerians in the UK (CANUK) would like to add its voice to the condemnation of the recent massacre at St Francis Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo State Nigeria. “CANUK Chairman Hon Ayo Akinfe said ‘We cannot find the right words with which to condemn this murderous act!’ “CANUK opines that All Nigerians must rise up with one voice and in one accord, protect what we have and bring back what we've lost to thrive. We have only this one earth which belongs to us all, let's take care of it. “On behalf of all Nigerian diasporans in the UK, CANUK commiserates with the families of all those who lost their lives in this unprovoked carnage. We also call for the immediate arrest and prosecution of the perpetrators of this and other similar ghastly acts. “The CANUK Exco on behalf of all Member Organisations and the entire Nigerian Community across the UK, calls on Nigerian Leaders and the Federal Government, to tighten security in the country and do more to ensure the safety of the lives of all Nigerians. “May the Souls that were lost during this sad incident find Peaceful Rest in Eternity.”
