President Muhammadu Buhari has reiterated that he will hand over in 2023 saying that the Nigerian leader, making reference to Olusegun Obasanjo, who attempted a third term agenda did not end well.According to Femi Adesina, presidential spokesman, Buhari spoke on Thursday during a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, at the 26th Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Kigali, Rwanda. During the meeting, the British prime minister had asked if Buhari would run for office again.In his respose, he said, “Another term for me? No! The first person who tried it didn’t end very well."Also speaking on Boko Haram insurgency, Buhari said there was serious effort to educate the people on the fact that only an unserious person could kill innocent people, “and say Allah Akbar (God is Great).”He said, "God is justice. You can’t take innocent souls, and ascribe it to God. And the education process is working, the people now understand that Boko Haram as anti-God, and not about religion.”He also reiterated his stance of not seeking third term in office.Buhari also denied claims that leader of the proscribed Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, was not allowed to see his lawyers privately.The president said the detained separatist was being given every opportunity under the law “to justify all the uncomplimentary things he had been saying against Nigeria in Britain.”He added, “He felt very safe in Britain, and said awful things against Nigeria. We eventually got him when he stepped out of the United Kingdom, and we sent him to court. Let him defend all that he has said there. His lawyers have access to him. Remember he jumped bail before, how are we sure he won’t do it again, if he’s admitted to bail?”
