The alleged victim, one Ukpo Nwamini David was said to have been trafficked from Nigeria and entered the UK with the passport of a 41-year-old man.The London Mail yesterday quoted the university’s spokesperson as saying that Ekweremadu’s duties at the institution had been suspended for the time being.“Visiting professors are often, as is in this case, non-resident at the university, unpaid and advisory,” the university’s spokesperson said.“We are deeply concerned about the nature of these allegations, but as this is an active police investigation, we cannot comment further at this stage.“Whilst this matter is subject to investigation, this person will not be undertaking any duties as visiting professor at Lincoln.”Ekweremadu in a tweet on June 12 noted, “It was a pleasure and an honour to receive a letter of appointment by the University of Lincoln, UK, as Visiting Professor of Corporate and International Linkages.“I also got a highly treasured gift – a copy of the Magna Carta. It was created in 1215, about 807 years ago.”Meanwhile, there are claims that the teenager at the centre of the organ harvesting allegation, is said to have entered the United Kingdom (UK) on the claim that he was 41 years old.
