Finland-based Nigerian, Simon Ekpa, has dared the Indigenous People of Biafra and family of the IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu, as he continues to identify himself as a disciple of the agitator.Last month, Kanu's family wrote Ekpa warning him to stop using Nnamdi Kanu’s name for material gains.In the letter dated May 17 and signed by Magnus Jonsson, the family said the Finland-based Nigerian should not mention Kanu's name nor use the agitator's image in any of his broadcasts. But on Tuesday, Ekpa posted a photograph of himself on which was boldly written, “I'm Simon Ekpa, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu's Disciple on Biafra Restoration.” The picture was posted on his Twitter with a caption, “Is the message in the picture bold enough?” The family of Kanu had warned Ekpa to stop defamatory publications against members of the Kanu family, and ensure such did not occur in any of his broadcasts.The Kanu family had warned they would also institute injunctive claims against Ekpa for civil injuries.The letter had read, “The Kanu family, both in Nigeria and in the diaspora, has retained undersigned to formally demand from you as follows: that you should forthwith cease and desist from using the name and image of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, either in your broadcasts or otherwise, for any material gain whatsoever including any fundraising.“That you should forthwith cease and desist from addressing yourself as a Disciple of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, either in the guise of you being a member of IPOB (which we are informed you are not) or in any other manner relating to the Biafran agitation.
