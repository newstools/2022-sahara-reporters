Babagana Kingibe, a former running mate to the late Chief Moshood Abiola, popularly known as MKO Abiola has endorsed the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu as Nigeria’s next President.  Abiola was the winner of the June 12, 1993, presidential election annulled by the Ibrahim Babangida-led military junta.  Speaking in a meeting with Tinubu at the weekend, Kingibe said the former Lagos governor will be Nigeria’s next president because of his sacrifices.  “Eyin lo kan (It’s your turn),” he said in Yoruba.  “You will move from Jagaban of Borgu to Jagaban of Nigeria; from Asiwaju of Lagos to Asiwaju of Nigeria. For all your sacrifices, for all your effort, God will reward you this time.”  Tinubu had while speaking in Abeokuta, Ogun State a few days before the APC presidential primary election sparked controversy when he said ‘emi lo kan’ (it’s my turn). “E gbe kini yi wa (Bring the Presidency),” he had also said. Despite being Abiola’s running mate, Kingibe betrayed the late politician and abandoned the struggle even while he was alive.  Abiola had said he was persuaded by his friends and political supporters to pick him as his running mate because of his political clout in the North and closeness to Major-General Shehu Musa Yar'Adua, who was the Deputy Head of State in the military regime of General Olusegun Obasanjo.

He served as foreign minister under Sani Abacha, the same dictator who arrested and jailed Abiola with whom he ran on the platform of the Social Democratic Party (SDP).  Abiola would later regret choosing Kingibe over Dan Suleiman, a retired air commodore and former military governor from the then Middle Belt. Abiola referred to Suleiman as a 'complete gentleman'. MKO said he did know that his running mate had "extensive connections and relationship" with the security agencies and the military high command. Kingibe contributed to the abortion of the third republic.  He was later honoured by President Muhammadu Buhari with Grand Commander of the Order of the Niger (GCON) solely because of being Abiola's running mate. An honour many Nigerians have said he does not deserve.
