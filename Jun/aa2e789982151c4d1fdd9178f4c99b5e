A grandmother and octogenarian, Mrs Comfort Onyia, has cried out for help from well-meaning Nigerians and the government to take care of three kids which her daughter-in-law who was murdered on Saturday by gunmen left behind. SaharaReporters had reported that gunmen suspected to be cultists had stormed a drinking joint in Akwuke, Enugu South Local Government Area of Enugu State and shot dead a pregnant woman and a vigilante member.  It reported that the assailants equally shot a secondary school girl, who was helping the pregnant woman in family chores in the leg. It was reported that three masked assailants had stormed the joint around 8pm and ordered everybody to lie down. The owner of the joint Felix Onyia, who also lived in the same compound with his family and ran the business together, had sensed danger and escaped through the back door but the pregnant wife was not so lucky. The assailants pursued her into her kitchen and shot her dead. Speaking to SaharaReporters on Wednesday evening, Mrs Onyia who looked so distraught with swollen legs said that since the incident, she had been confused. Lamenting the gruesome murder of her pregnant daughter-in-law, with three kids of ages one to five, in addition to her son's ill health, who was bedridden for seven months, she said life was too much for her to bear. "I seek justice for my daughter-in-law and call on well-meaning Nigerians, the government of Enugu State and philanthropists to come to help. Where will I start with these kids? They are so tender, look at my age with ill-health. People should come and help to navigate this trial." Although, she said that she did not live with her daughter-in-law, she had not heard that her daughter-in-law quarrelled with anybody since her son married her. "I enjoined all the security agencies and the government of Enugu State to ensure that these assailants were brought to justice," she pleaded.
