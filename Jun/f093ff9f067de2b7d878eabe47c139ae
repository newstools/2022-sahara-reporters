A Muslim community in Osun State has called on Adegboyega Oyetola’s government to make the Sharia Court in the state part of the judicial system.  The President of the Muslim community, Mustafa Olawuyi, made the call on Sunday while speaking to journalists during the community’s 25th-anniversary celebration in Osogbo, the state capital.  According to Daily Post, Olawuyi said the Muslim community had achieved a lot in the state since the community established a Sharia Court where many issues including boundary disputes had been resolved.  He said, “We have been able to settle a lot of issues through the Sharia court, even boundary issues, we have settled.  “Government should recognise the Sharia court as part of the judiciary system in Osun State like what happens in Kwara and other states. We are one Nigeria. We should come together to work as one indivisible entity.”  According to him, the Sharia Court has been able to settle a lot of cases without anybody taking offence or resulting in killing or attacking other people.
