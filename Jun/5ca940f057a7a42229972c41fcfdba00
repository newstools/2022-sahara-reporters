According to him, Gulak’s killers approached him to convey them in his vehicle to a spot but he resisted. He, however, said he later succumbed as they threatened to kill him. He admitted to driving the criminals to the spot and blocked Gulak’s vehicle which was on its way to the airport. Chimaobi said the criminals shot at Gulak after the All Progressives Congress Chieftain resisted the demand by the gunmen to alight from the vehicle. According to Chimobi, the hoodlums later ran into a team of security operatives who shot repeatedly at the other vehicle conveying them until it somersaulted and caught fire.
