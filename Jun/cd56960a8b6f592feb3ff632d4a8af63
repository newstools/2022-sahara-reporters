Commercial bike riders in the Idi-Araba area of Lagos State, on Tuesday, protested against the seizure of their motorcycles by officials of the Lagos State Task Force and the Nigeria Police Force. SaharaReporters gathered that the security officials had visited the area to enforce the state government's ban on motorcycles. However, this enraged the riders, popularly known as Okada riders, who blocked a major road, restricting vehicular movements.  Media reports claimed the incident was a clash between police officers and the motorcyclists but the Lagos State Police spokesperson, Benjamin Hundeyin said there was no clash. According to him, the task force officials went to impound motorcycles in the area but after their departure, the riders became unruly, causing road blockage and stopping vehicles from moving. He, however, said police officers had been dispatched to the area to restore calm to the axis. He explained, “There was no clash, policemen impounded motorcycles and those riders decided to be unruly. They blocked the road so that vehicles will not pass. Immediately we got information of that, we dispatched officers and opened the road for vehicles to pass."
