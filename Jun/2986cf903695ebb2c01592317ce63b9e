The National Leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and one of the party’s presidential aspirants, Bola Tinubu, on Tuesday, staggered and nearly fell while stepping out to make his address at the Eagle Square, the venue of the party’s convention but was helped by a security guard. During his speech at the convention, the hands of the former Lagos governor were also visibly shaking, a possible sign of ill health.  Despite repeated controversies surrounding his health and age, the 70-year-old former Governor of Lagos State has insisted that he is the only qualified aspirant to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023.
