Mr Kabir Ibrahim Masari, the running mate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu has informed the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) that his school certificates are missing. This comes amid the controversy surrounding the supposed loss of Tinubu’s credentials.  SaharaReporters had reported how the late legal luminary, Gani Fawehinmi sued Tinubu for lying under oath that he attended Government College, Ibadan and the University of Chicago. It reported that Tinubu had made the claim of loss of certificates in his filings with INEC in 1999 and 2003 when he ran for governor of Lagos State. Amidst this controversy, his running mate Mr Masari also filed a sworn affidavit for the loss of some original documents to the nation's electoral body. Peoples Gazette reported that the affidavit the APC vice-presidential candidate submitted to INEC showed that he misplaced vital documents including the Certificate of Occupancy (C of O) of one plot KT 17522 in Katsina state, his Grade II certificate from Katsina Teachers College and his primary school certificate.
