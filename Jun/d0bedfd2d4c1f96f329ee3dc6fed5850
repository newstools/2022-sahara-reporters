The Nigeria Police Force, Lagos command, has reacted to a video circulating on the internet with the claim that an American woman raised the alarm after she was brought to Nigeria via diabolical means by internet fraudsters popularly known as “Yahoo boys.”The video was shared widely on Instagram on Wednesday alongside a voice note. The narrator claimed the white woman, said she came into the country three days ago but did not know how the young man (the fraudster) was able to convince her to come.However, the spokesperson of the Lagos State Police Command, Benjamin Hundeyin had debunked the claim stating that the woman, a German, had a misunderstanding with her Nigerian husband whom she had been living with since 2019.He said the misunderstanding escalated such that the neighbours had to intervene.However, the couple were taken to the police station and had since resolved the issue. The woman, Hundeyin said, refused to be taken to the German embassy and had returned home to her husband. Hundeyin tweeted on Wednesday evening, “False narrative! The woman is German. She has been living with her husband in that same house since February 2019. They had a misunderstanding yesterday which necessitated neighbours intervening. The police arrived on time and took her to the station.“She declined to be taken to the German embassy. She insisted on going back home with her husband. The husband too very willingly made up with her. They are happily back home. Note: I deliberately left out the names to give them their privacy."
