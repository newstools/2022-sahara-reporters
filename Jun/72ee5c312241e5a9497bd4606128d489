A Magistrate Court sitting in the Wuse area of Abuja, has granted bail to Ameerah Sufyan, an Abuja resident and tweep who had claimed she and 16 others were kidnapped by gunmen in police uniforms. The tweep, @Ameerah_sufyan, had been charged to court by the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Police Command for raising a false alarm on social media.  On June 14, Ameerah took to her Twitter handle with the claim that she and 16 other residents of Abuja were kidnapped at gunpoint and taken to a forest. According to her, the victims, including three pregnant women and two children, were abducted by men in police uniforms. She tweeted, “Please whoever has my WhatsApp number I sent a broadcast message of my location; we were abducted at gunpoint by ppl with police uniforms and a van from our houses from different parts of Abuja, we’re 17 including 3 pregnant women and two little kids, they didn’t see my phone. “They’re 4 Yoruba and two Fulani men. They divided us up an hour ago; we’re 7 here. The other vehicle they said they will reach Ilorin and ours will reach Ibadan or Ikeja as they said.” However, the Nigerian police announced Ameerah's arrest after which she posted an apology on social media noting that her tweet was borne out of her “wild” imaginations. She was arraigned before the court on Wednesday but was granted bail over mental health issues. Bail conditions include being on probation for 12 months, including refraining from social media. She has also been mandated to report to her probation officer.
