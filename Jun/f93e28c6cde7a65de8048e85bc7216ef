Siminialayi Fubara, the River State Peoples Democratic Party governorship candidate in the 2023 general election, has escaped an attempted arrest by operatives of anti-graft agency, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission.It was gathered that the incident happened at the Port Harcourt International Airport on Tuesday night when Fubara, with his entourage, arrived Port-Harcourt from Abuja. According to PUNCH, officers of EFCC had moved to arrest Fubara but some youth suspected to be his loyalists attacked them to stop the arrest which resulted in some of the EFCC operatives sustaining injuries.Recall that the EFCC had declared Fubara, the immediate past Accountant General of Rivers State, and three other top state government officials wanted over alleged N117billion fraud.After the drama at the airport, Fubara who won the state PDP governorship primary on May 25 proceeded to the state party secretariat where he addressed party supporters and stakeholders.In his reaction, the state Commissioner of Police, Friday Eboka, said he was not aware of the incident, noting that his office was not extended to the airport.
