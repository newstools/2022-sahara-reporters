The Director General of the National Youth Service Corps, Brig Gen Muhammad Kaku Fadah, has advised corps members to avoid travelling at night and boarding vehicles from unauthorised motor parks which may expose them to danger. Fadah also advised them to embrace the Skill Acquisition and Entrepreneurship Development (SAED) programme of the Scheme to acquire vocational skills that will make them job creators when they complete the service year.  The NYSC DG gave the advice on Thursday, while addressing corps members at the Anambra State Orientation Camp in Mbaukwu/Mbawulu and Enugu State Orientation Camp, Awgu respectively. A statement by NYSC Director, Press and Public Relations, Eddy Megwa, "Avoid Night Journeys, DG Counsels Corps Members", quoted the DG to have promised the corps members that the management had put adequate security arrangements in place throughout their service year. He however, urged the Corps members to complement the efforts by adhering to personal safety precautions and avoiding risky adventures. Fadah also admonished the corps members to provide projects that would improve the living standards of their host communities and also serve as good legacies after their service year. The NYSC Anambra State Coordinator, Mrs Iruma Blessing, said the corps members had already keyed into the Skill Acquisition and other orientation programmes with high spirit. "We have a total of 1,793 Corps Members comprising 766 makes and 1,027 females", she said.
