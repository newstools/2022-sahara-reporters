A young man and Ondo State resident, who identified himself simply as Sunday, has warned residents of the state and neighbouring Kogi State to be more vigilant as he alleged that killer herdsmen had taken over the highways.Sunday, who recalled how the herdsmen shot dead his dad in April 2022, noted that the herdsmen were now engaging in a killing spree without resistance by security agents. Speaking with SaharaReporters on Wednesday, Sunday narrated that his father was shot dead while driving along the Kabba—Ajowa axis by the gunmen who had made the road a focal point of attack on unsuspecting Nigerians.According to him, this could have given the gunmen an easy access to penetrate Owo town of Ondo State and any other part of the state.He said the bloody attack on St. Francis Catholic Church in Owo on Sunday was not unconnected with some nefarious activities of the gunmen in the state, some of which go unreported in the media.He said, “My dad was killed along Kabba, Kogi to Ajowa road in Ondo state on April 16. He was coming home from a journey because he was a driver. He was ambushed by gunmen on the road and they shot him dead. A month after his death, another of such incident occurred in the same axis.“My Daddy, Abbey Toyin also known as Malla was killed in that place. He was almost home. The distance between where he was killed and our home is just about 1 kilometre. He was almost home when he was attacked. His routes are from Ajowa to Abuja but passes through Kogi. I was in Lagos when I received the unfortunate message.”We later learnt that some Fulani herdsmen were arrested in connection with the incident but the herders were brought to police headquarters in Akure and since then, we haven't heard anything about it.”These attackers are on the prowl already and people in the state have to be vigilant because there are some things that happen but do not get reported by the media.”
