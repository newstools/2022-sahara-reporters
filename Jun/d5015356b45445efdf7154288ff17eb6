The Nigerian Senate on Wednesday confirmed all seven ministerial nominees forwarded by President Muhammadu Buhari for screening and confirmation. SaharaReporters earlier reported that President Buhari after the resignation of some of his former ministers to pursue their political ambitions forwarded seven names to the upper legislative chamber as replacements.  The ministerial nominees will take up the vacant positions left by the former Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi; former Minister of Science and Technology; Ogbonnaya Onu; former Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio; and former Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba, among others, who recently resigned to seek political offices. At the close of the plenary last Wednesday, Lawan disclosed that the “ministerial nominees will be screened on Wednesday, next week (today, June 29)”. President Buhari, in a letter dated June 15, 2022, requested the Senate to confirm the nomination of seven ministerial nominees. He said the confirmation request was made in accordance with Section 147(2) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, as amended. The nominees for confirmation are Henry Ikechukwu Ikoh – Abia State; Umana Okon Umana – Akwa Ibom State; Ekumankama Joseph Nkama- Ebonyi State; Goodluck Nanah Opiah – Imo State; Umar Ibrahim El-Yakub – Kano State; Ademola Adewole Adegoroye – Ondo State; and Odum Udi – Rivers State.
