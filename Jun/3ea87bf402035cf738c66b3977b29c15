Katsina State Governor, Aminu Masari has urged the newly-elected local government executives in the state to stop running to cities for fear of bandits. Masari on Wednesday, at a security sensitisation workshop organised for newly-elected local council officials in Katsina, challenged the council leaders to stay in their localities and end the menace of banditry. Governor Aminu Masari The governor told the new executives that the appointment was an opportunity for them to help their people, noting that they were aware of the challenges in their areas before showing interest in taking up the leadership position, Daily Post reports. “You presented yourselves as chairmen and councillors bearing in mind the huge responsibilities attached to your offices. “We know that we are in a very challenging time but what is leadership without challenges? From the little resources that we have locally, if you are determined to work, you can use it to the benefit of your people. “You must stay in your local government. The least you can do for your people is to let them see that you share in their sorrow and grief.  “When something happens in your local government and you are called upon, stop saying you are in Abuja, Kano or nowhere to be found.  “Let us face our challenges head-on because nobody will do it for us.” Katsina and other North-West states have been ravaged by banditry. Bandits terrorise villages by killing and abducting residents for ransom. They also collect levies from villagers in many ungoverned areas.
