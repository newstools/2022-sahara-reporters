Former Lagos Governor and presidential aspirant of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu has said it is the turn of the South-West region to produce the President of Nigeria. He added that he was the best candidate for the position having served other people for a long time.  Tinubu noted this while addressing Ogun APC delegates ahead of the party’s primaries at the presidential lodge in Abeokuta on Thursday. The APC chieftain who boasted that he led a political struggle that produced President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo in 2015, said he understands the political terrain more than every other person having served for more than two decades. According to him, the country's presidency is not the sole right of the North, adding that it is the turn of Yoruba people to lead. He said, “It is my time, it is not about age. If it's about education, I am educated, I am experienced. I have been serving you for a long time. Bring me the presidency, it is my turn! When Atiku was flogged out of PDP by Obasanjo, he ran to merit help. “The same with Nuhu Ribadu, he came and I backed him. It's now my turn, it has been over 25 years now that I have been serving them.” He added: “This is our time. The presidency is not only meant for the north. Buhari would not have been president but for me. He contested three times and failed. “He even vowed on national TV never to contest again but I encouraged him and gave him a condition never to joke with the Yorubas. He agreed and won. “And since he became president, I have never gotten any ministerial slot but this time, it is the turn of the Yorubas to rule, even then, it is my turn.”
