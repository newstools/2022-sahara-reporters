The Islamic State-backed faction of Boko Haram, the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), formerly known as Jamā'at Ahl as-Sunnah lid-Da'wah wa'l-Jihād, has claimed that its fighters killed four soldiers during an attack on military barracks in Banki town, Borno State.  Banki, located in the Bama Local Government Area of the state, is 2.5 km from the Cameroonian border and 135 km from Maiduguri.  The town was one of Borno’s major economic hubs outside Maiduguri and was famous for huge day and night economic activities, until it was sacked by insurgents in 2014, forcing residents to flee to neighbouring Cameroon and the Niger Republic.  ISWAP in a statement sighted by SaharaReporters on Friday said four soldiers were killed while one was injured during an attack on military barracks in the community on Tuesday, June 7.  The terror group added that it razed down military operational vehicles.  Since the death of JAS leader, Abubakar Shekau, ISWAP has been consolidating its grip in locations around Lake Chad.  The sect’s membership has swollen with the defection of hundreds of Boko Haram fighters under Shekau.  The Nigerian army has repeatedly claimed that the insurgency has been largely defeated.  The terror group has caused over 100,000 deaths and displaced millions of individuals mainly in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe states.
