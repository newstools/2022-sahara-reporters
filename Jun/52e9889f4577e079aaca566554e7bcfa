The Nigeria Police Force has described the shooting incident involving its personnel at Club Cubana in Victoria Island, Lagos on Wednesday night as despicable and condemnable.  SaharaReporters earlier reported that five policemen attached to Nigerian singer, Damini Ogulu, aka Burna Boy had been detained by the Lagos police command for attempted murder after they shot two fun-seekers.  The victims were identified as Irebami Lawrence and Tolu. Burna Boy was said to have been laughing while the incident occurred and immediately left for Spain shortly after.  But a statement on Sunday, by the Force Public Relations Officer, CSP Olumuyiwa Adejobi, titled: "Re: Club Shooting In Lagos", described the circumstances surrounding the incident as unbelievable.
