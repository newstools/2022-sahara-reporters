A former Niger Delta militant, Asari Dokubo, on Thursday said his faithfulness to former president Goodluck Jonathan, affected his relationship with a former Lagos State governor, Bola Tinubu. Tinubu emerged as the presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) on Wednesday.  Dokubu explained that he severed communications with Tinubu and all other prominent members of the ruling APC – including President Muhammadu Buhari because of his loyalty to former President Goodluck Jonathan. Dokubo during a Facebook Live, said, “I cut off communication with Tinubu because of Goodluck in 2014.  “I was in Mecca for Hajj, with the present Minister for Interior, Rauf Aregbesola. I went to his hotel room to see him, that was in 2013, and he said ‘why are you following Goodluck?’  "He said Goodluck will not do you anything good. He said, ‘why don’t you stay where you are celebrated?’ All of us celebrate you. And I told him I cannot betray my people. I stood by Goodluck and cut off friendships with Rauf Aregbesola, Adams Oshiomhole, Kayode Fayemi, Tinubu himself, and even President Buhari. “Tinubu wanted me to be in politics, I did not. I sacrificed those relationships for my people and I’m not regretting it," he added. Asari-Dokubo was formerly Melford Dokubo Goodhead Jr. and typically referred to simply as Asari, is a major political figure of the Ijaw ethnic group in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. Asari-Dokubo was 2001 the president of the Ijaw Youth Council.
