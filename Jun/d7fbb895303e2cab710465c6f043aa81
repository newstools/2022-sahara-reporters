There is uneasy calm at Wase Local Government Area of Plateau State following the expiration of a 5-day quit notice served on 10 communities in the council to relocate or face dire consequences by bandits.  SaharaReporters gathered on Thursday, that the affected communities include Gindin Dutse, Anguwan Tsohon Soldier, Anguwan Yuhana, Sabon Zama and Anguwan Mangu.  A resident who spoke to SaharaReporters on condition of anonymity confirmed that the Islamic terrorists also called 'bandits' had visited some of the communities over the weekend to issue the ultimatum. “They also threatened to kill anyone who disobeyed the order,” the source said.  He said that residents of the affected villages and communities have since Wednesday started leaving their homes before today (Thursday) when the deadline elapsed.  Meanwhile, the state government hasn't issued any official statement on the development.  However, efforts made by SaharaReporters on Thursday to get the reaction of the State Police Command were unsuccessful as the Command's spokesman, DSP Alfred Alabo, could not be reached on the telephone.  He has yet to reply to a text message SaharaReporters sent to him.
