David Nwamini Ukpo, the young man involved in the organ harvesting allegations against a former Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu and his wife, Beatrice, has broken his silence. Ukpo, whose kidney was to be harvested for Sonia, daughter of the Ekweremadus, said he was lured to the UK and the move was without his consent.  The Nigerian couple have been arrested and charged in the UK for attempting to harvest the kidney of Ukpo. They were denied bail by a London magistrates’ court where they were arraigned hours after their arrest last Thursday, June 23, 2022. Ukpo on Facebook on Saturday, June 25, 2022, shared his side of the story in a post titled, ‘My journey to UK.’ His unedited post reads, “On one fateful day I met a man named okoro in a building site where I was working for my daily bread, okoro told me he like me, he want to help me achieve my dream because he saw me as a great person.
