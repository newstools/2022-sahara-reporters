Our message might just be reaching the social media space but If a thousand action has been taken on locating her, our last comment on her post would probably be the 999th. While physical action has since been deployed, this is just to assure everyone that we are on it . Thereâs so much information embedded in her ability to access or not to access her DM. So much was said in few lines. So much more than âcheck your DMâ
