This was disclosed by the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Youth and Sports Development, Ismaila Abubakar at a news conference in Abuja on Thursday. He said the latest decision is based on a letter of appeal from the Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF), signed by Mr Musa Kida.  SaharaReporters earlier reported that President Muhammadu Buhari approved the immediate withdrawal of Nigeria from all international basketball competitions for a period of two years with immediate effect.  This was announced by Abubakar, who said a committee would be set up to oversee basketball leagues in the country.  “Following the unending crises which have plagued and nearly crippled the development of basketball in Nigeria, President Buhari has approved the withdrawal of Nigeria from all international basketball competitions for a period of two years. “This is with immediate effect,” he had said.  The minister added that the withdrawal of Nigeria was in order to concentrate efforts by the government towards revamping the sport from the grassroots as well as domestic leagues which have become moribund.  “This will also allow for the setting up of an Interim Management Committee (IMC) to oversee the management and development of the domestic basketball leagues in Nigeria,” he had added.
