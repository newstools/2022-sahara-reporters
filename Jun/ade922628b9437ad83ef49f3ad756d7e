The National Peace Committee has stated that all governorship candidates for the Saturday June 18, governorship election in Ekiti State are expected to sign a peace accord on Wednesday, 72 hours to the election.This was stated in a release by the Chairman of the Committee and former Head of State, Abdusalami Abubakar. The committee also urged the electorates in Ekiti State, South-West Nigeria to come out to vote, noting that high turnout of voters at the governorship election would deepen democracy in the state and the country and offer a glimmer of hope and window of opportunity to assess how the 2023 general elections would span out.Abubakar explained that voters who sacrificed to elect who would be in control of the helm of affairs for the next four years were the true custodians of democracy and had embraced the best form of government for Nigeria.He also advised the youths to discard vote-buying for the interest of national security and stability.He emphasised that the future of Nigeria should remain their common priority towards making themselves ambassadors of peace for the continuous build-up of the country’s democracy.Last Sunday, six governorship candidates in the race to succeed Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State came face-to-face in a debate about their plans and policies if elected into office.The Ekiti governorship election holds on July 18 and 16 candidates would be on the ballot.The candidates who participated in last Sunday’s debate were: Oluwole Oluyede of the African Democratic Congress (ADC); Kemi Elebute Halle of the Action Democratic Party (ADP); Biodun Oyebanji of the All Progressives Congress (APC); Olabisi Kolawole of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP); former Governor Segun Oni of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and Ranti Ajayi from the Young Progressives Party (YPP).
