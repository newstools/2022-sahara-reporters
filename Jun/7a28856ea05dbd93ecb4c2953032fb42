The Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Leo Irabor has called for the identification of disgruntled, greedy and unmotivated military personnel.  Irabor, in a letter sent to all commanders of various operations, which was exclusively obtained by SaharaReporters, said the deployment of such personnel does not benefit the service and is in fact counter-productive.  “1.  It has been observed that some personnel are disgruntled or overcome by greed for various reasons. Notably, such personnel would be unable to exhibit the high level of undivided loyalty and presence of mind required of military operations,” the letter, signed on behalf of the CDS by one MB Nagenu, read.  “In view of the above, deployment of such personnel do (sic) not benefit the Service and are (sic) in fact counter-productive.  “2.  Consequently, on identification of disgruntled or unmotivated personnel, services are advised to take steps to compulsory discharge or retire such personnel in line with extant laws instead of deployment.  “3.  Please accept the esteemed warm regards of the CDS.”  Soldiers deployed for counterinsurgency operations in Borno State, northeast Nigeria recently lamented that those who were to relieve them three months after they were asked to leave the battlefield had yet to resume.  The soldiers complained that they were being forced to confront Boko Haram militants, adding that their low morale and lack of willingness to continue to fight made it possible for terrorists to dislodge some military camps recently.  They asked why the army commanders had refused to send those expected to relieve them to the battlefield three months after rotation.
