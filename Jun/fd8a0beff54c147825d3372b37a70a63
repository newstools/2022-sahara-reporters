The Ogun State chapter of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) has called for justice for a married woman, Maimuna Ibrahim and two other herders who were allegedly killed in different parts of the state.  Ibrahim, it was gathered was set ablaze on May 21 at Shotinbo town along Shagamu/Ogijo and was hospitalised. She, however, later gave up the ghost.  Also, two herdsmen were killed by assailants in Abeokuta, the state capital on Sunday night.  MACBAN called for the immediate arrest and prosecution of the killers in order to guarantee continuous peace across the state.  The state Chairman of MACBAN, Alhaji Ibrahim Abubakar Dende, told Daily Trust, that the development was capable of causing a great disaffection in the state where the majority of them were born.  He also asked the state government for financial assistance to offset the medical bills of those hospitalised over the incident.  According to the report, the killers allegedly trailed the herdsmen and attacked them for refusing to re-direct their cows from grazing at the Adehun axis of the Roundabout area of the Abeokuta metropolis.  It was learnt that one of the suspects had during the day had an open confrontation with the herders, where he allegedly ordered them to keep off grazing their cows in the area.  “Government should help us prevail on the people of the Community Development Associations (CDAs) across the state that we are not bad people; such is an act of character assassination,” Dende said.  A team from the state government, led by the Special Assistant to Governor Dapo Abiodun on Security Matters, Biyi Odubote, and his counterpart on Inter-Ethnic Affairs, Hadi Sanni, has met with the leadership of the Fulani community to commiserate with them on the incident.
