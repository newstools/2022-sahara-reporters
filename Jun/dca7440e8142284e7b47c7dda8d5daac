A petrol tanker laden with Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), popularly known as petrol, Thursday morning, burst into flames, killing its driver and destroying property in Plateau State, SaharaReporters learnt.  An eyewitness who spoke on condition of anonymity told SaharaReporters that the driver of the tanker lost control, veered off at Polo roundabout and crashed into a filling station before the explosion.  One person reportedly died in the inferno and several buildings burnt, including the filling station.  "The truck was on high speed and I think the driver had brakes failure while trying to negotiate the Polo roundabout around 'Gada Biu' on Kaduna-Jos Road; it then crashed into a filling station by the roundabout and burst into flames.  "Yes, the driver was burnt to ashes. The filling station was also burnt alongside several buildings within the radius of the accident," the eyewitness said.  At the time of filing this report, there was no official confirmation of the incident.
