The Islamic State-backed faction of Boko Haram, the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), formerly known as Jamā'at Ahl as-Sunnah lid-Da'wah wa'l-Jihād, has claimed that its fighters killed three soldiers during an attack on a military barrack in Monguno, Borno State.Monguno is North, about 70km drive from Maiduguri, the state capital and hosted thousands of Internally Displaced Persons mostly from Dikwa and Marte council areas. ISWAP in a post said the soldiers were “killed with automatic weapons while others were injured during an attack on a military barracks in the community last week.”According to the terror group, its “fighters burnt a military operational vehicle and captured another one.”The terrorists added that three humanitarian workers allegedly from Red Cross Society were abducted.Since the death of JAS leader, Abubakar Shekau, ISWAP has been consolidating its grip in locations around Lake Chad.Just recently, it appointed Wali Sani Shuwaram, a 45-year-old as the new Leader (Wali) of ISWAP in Lake Chad.The sect’s membership has swollen with the defection of hundreds of Boko Haram fighters under Shekau.The Nigerian Army has repeatedly claimed that insurgency had been largely defeated and frequently underplays any losses.The terror group has caused over 100,000 deaths and displaced millions of individuals mainly in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe states.
