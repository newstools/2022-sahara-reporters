Suspected terrorists have reportedly killed two policemen, a university lecturer and two other people during an attack on two local government areas of Benue State.

A resident on Friday confirmed that the policemen were shot and killed while their guns were taken away by the terrorists at about 10 pm on Thursday. Another source disclosed that Jootar killings involved three friends identified as Fred Akaayar, a lecturer in the Department of Mass Communication at the Federal University, Wukari in Taraba State; Aondo Ayange Apever and Shiaondo Kachina. The source said the three friends were unwinding at a relaxation centre in Jootar when the gunmen who rode on a motorcycle shot at them around 7 pm on Thursday.
