BBC The Ondo-born pro-democracy activist said this in a series of posts on his verified Twitter page, @YeleSowore, on Sunday. He said the security situation in Nigeria has got to the point when people should get off their knees and stop what he described as hypocritical politicians.  As the country surges with political activities ahead of the 2023 general elections, the #RevolutionNow convener said citizens must find the courage to say ‘Enough is enough'.  Also posting a photo of the Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, looking at the ground and surrounded by security personnel and his entourage, Sowore said, “I hope @RotimiAkeredolu is not praying here, because it is time to wake up, it is time for people to get off their knees. According to the Bishop, most of those killed today were observing mass. Stop these hypocritical politicians! #EnoughIsEnough #WeCantContinueLikeThis.

A time to say enough is enough. Nobody has a right to take innocent lives.  “Your govt is only effective when it is time to kill, not when to protect you and your loved ones! #WeCantContinueLikeThis.  “A man in Abuja was killed yesterday over blasphemy and today terrorists entered a Catholic Church in Owo killing over 50, in both cases @PoliceNG did not respond on time, no ambulances to save victims. People in govt are carrying on as if this is normal! #WeCantContinueLikeThis.”
