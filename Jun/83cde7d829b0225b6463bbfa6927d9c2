Some Nigerians on Twitter have berated Abdullahi Garba Ramat, who is the chairman of Ungogo local government area of Kano for flaunting seven flashy vehicles. The vehicles in the convoy of the council chairman could be seen in a video being driven on a dusty road in a poor neighbourhood that contrasts heavily with the expensive convoy of vehicles.  The head-turning convoy consists of a Toyota Tacoma (pilot car), Lincoln Navigator, Land Rover Freelander, Toyota Land Cruiser Prado, Mercedes-Benz GLE and GLS as well as a Ford Explorer. In the video seen by SaharaReporters, the local chairman was spotted making his way to a function with a convoy that comprises the sophisticated cars. Mixed reactions have trailed the clip as some tweeps found it unpleasant and knocked him for it.  Kano State Local Govt.
