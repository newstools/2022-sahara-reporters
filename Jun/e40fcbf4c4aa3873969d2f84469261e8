The Plateau State Police Command has confirmed the abduction of the traditional ruler of Panyam, Mangu Local Government Area in Plateau State, His Royal Highness, Aminu Derwan, by Islamic terrorists.  The command's spokesman, Alabo Alfred, told SaharaReporters on Monday that the police had deployed their assets to track down the hoodlums and rescue the traditional ruler.  It was gathered that over 20 Islamic terrorists masquerading as bandits stormed the monarch's palace and took him away after scaring residents with gunshots in the early hours of Monday.  One of the residents of the community, Moses Garuba, told The PUNCH that the hoodlums surrounded the district head’s palace in Panyam for several minutes, shooting sporadically before gaining entrance into the palace.  He said, “It was last night around midnight that the bandits, who were more than 20 and heavily armed, surrounded the district head’s palace in Panyam.  “Because his house was not fenced, some villagers who saw how his house was surrounded by strange people alerted other members of the community through a community bell. But immediately the bandits heard the bell, they started firing gunshots and eventually went away with the traditional ruler, leaving the community helpless.”  Some other residents also condemned the incessant attacks in the community which have been going on unabated.  They said the incident had been reported to the police division in the locality.  Confirming the abduction to SaharaReporters, the command's spokesman Alabo, said the state commissioner of police was on top of the situation.  He said, "Since last night, all our divisional police officers, Command Tactical Squad and Anti-kidnapping Squad, all of them are working to secure his release. Hopefully, we'll get a result soon."
