Not sure because some of the scammers are people who are not exactly begging for food, but have depraved mindsets that worship money. Is poverty then really the cause? You are a man of integrity and a visionary, with everything Iâve heard about how ADC primaries went, please kindly defect from that kind of a political party IMMEDIATELY, because your effort will be frustrated no matter how you try. If the system and orientation of Nigeria and Nigerians doesn't change. All sides will remain the same.We are simply comparing bad and worse give peter obi full support if u truly mean well for us sir. I LOVE YOU SHA
