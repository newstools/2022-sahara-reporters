A motorcyclist along the Jakande Estate/Isheri Road was almost lynched by a mob on Thursday morning after he reportedly hit a pedestrian who died on the spot.  The motorcyclist, according to a statement by the Lagos State Police spokesperson, Benjamin Hundeyin, allegedly veered off the road and hit the yet-to-be-identified person.  Unfortunately, the pedestrian died on the spot attracting the anger of passersby who decided to lynch the rider.  The rider was, however, saved by police officers who took him to the hospital for treatment. The deceased person was also evacuated by the police.  However, upon return to the scene, police said the angry mob had already burnt the motorcycle. Meanwhile, officers have been dispatched to restore calm to the area.  Hundeyin reiterated the stance of the Command against jungle justice, adding that anyone found engaging in such would be dealt with in accordance with the law.  He said, “It is important to clear the air on what’s going on at Jakande Estate/Isheri Road. This morning, a motorcycle rider veered off the road and hit a pedestrian. Unfortunately, the pedestrian fell and died on the spot. People around decided to lynch the motorcycle rider.  “The Police arrived at the scene on time and rescued the motorcycle rider from lynching. The Police immediately took the rider to the hospital for treatment and evacuated the pedestrian. Before the Police arrived back at the scene, an angry mob was already burning the motorcycles left behind by the fleeing riders.  “The Lagos State Police Command condemns jungle justice in very strong terms.
