A popular Islamic preacher from the north, Sheikh Yahya Masussuka, has rejected the clamour for a Muslim-Muslim ticket, being canvassed by some stakeholders of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) for its presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu.The cleric declared that those pushing for a Muslim-Muslim ticket are agents of injustice and enemies of peace, as according to him, they are acting at variance with the tenets of Islam. SaharaReporters had on Tuesday reported that an Islamic preacher from northern Nigeria warned against pairing Tinubu with a Christian from the northern region as his running mate ahead of the 2023 general elections.The preacher and some others like him had threatened to mobilise Muslims to reject Tinubu and the APC during the forthcoming presidential election.Similarly, SaharaReporters earlier reported on Tuesday that the ruling APC may force a Muslim-Muslim ticket on Nigerians as Tinubu’s camp narrowed down to Kashim Shettima, a former governor of Borno, to be his running mate.Reacting to these developments, Masussuka in a viral video, insisted that competence, justice and physical fitness were the qualities outlined in the Islamic traditions to guide Muslims in choosing a leader.The Sheikh argued that in Nigeria, going by the demographics of religion it was impossible for either Muslims or Christians to do it alone in the political sphere.He said, "it is another political season in Nigeria and we have the honour to give guidelines; we are taught by our statutes that justice precedes prayer either in the Islamic or Christian faith."I'm sending this sermon to both Muslim and Christian listeners, urging you to avoid either Muslim or Christian clerics who emphasise religion in their divisive sermons for political gains."Don't be deceived, in Islam competence and justice form the yardstick and not religious practices. Those advocating Muslim-Muslim ticket for Nigeria's nest presidency are doing a disservice to our religion, because Islam promotes justice and peace."I make bold to say this because Nigeria is a heterogeneous country with Muslims and Christians represented in large numbers. It is therefore unthinkable for anyone to contemplate fielding a Muslim-Muslim ticket and think he's being Islamic in conduct."Nigeria needs competent and just leaders who would do justice to all manner of people regardless of religious considerations", he said.
