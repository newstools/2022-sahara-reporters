The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Kaduna State, has accused the federal and state governments of keeping silent while Islamic terrorists under the cloak of bandits massacre Christians in the state.  The State CAN Chairman, Rev. John Joseph Hayab, who stated this in a statement on Sunday, described the killings as too many and the lack of concern by the government as “disappointing and disgraceful”.  “The bandits are now hardened and brutal. They are killing without mercy and the rate at which they have turned on the Church in Kaduna State and Nigeria is alarming and worrisome," he said. He added, “The last three weekends have all been periods of mourning and anguish from our communities to the church.”  He lamented the killing of Rev Fr Vitus Borogo on his farm on Saturday. Borogo, 50, was killed at Prison Farm, Kujama, along Kaduna-Kachia Road, following a raid on the farm by terrorists. The deceased priest was the Chaplain of the Catholic Community of the Kaduna State Polytechnic, and the Chairman of the Nigerian Catholic Diocesan Priests Association (NCDPA), Kaduna Chapter.
