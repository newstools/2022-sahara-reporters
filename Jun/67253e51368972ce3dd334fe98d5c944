Gunmen ravaging Anambra State in South-East Nigeria have reportedly killed two persons at Nkwele around Housing Estate 33 in the commercial city of Onitsha in Anambra State. Residents of the area said they were fears and apprehension early Monday morning due to sporadic shooting by the gunmen, after which two unidentified persons were confirmed to have been shot dead.  Although residents said the killing might not be connected to the usual Monday sit-at-home in the region, a source confirmed to SaharaReporters that many residents of the area were indoors following the incident and in observance of the sit-at-home order. “I heard there was sporadic shooting at Nkwele, that is around the Housing Estate 33 this morning but I didn’t go to the place myself, but my friend at that place confirmed that two persons were killed. “We have not ascertained the identities of the victims.” When contacted, the state police public relations officer, DSP Tochukwu Ikenga, said, “There is such report before me please.” Meanwhile, despite the cancellation of the sit-at-home order by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), which declared it in 2021 after the rearrest of its leader, Nnamdi Kanu, by the Nigerian government, a Finland-based IPOB member, Simon Ekpa has continued to instigate enforcement of the order. Many persons have been killed and property destroyed across the region by armed hoodlums suspected to be enforcing the cancelled sit-at-home order.
