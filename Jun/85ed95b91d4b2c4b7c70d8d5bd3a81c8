The abductors of a retired Chief Pharmacist with the Ekiti Ministry of Health, Mr Israel Bamisaye, have demanded N40 million as ransom to free him. It was learnt that the kidnappers contacted the victim’s family on the phone to demand a ransom of N40 million in cash to secure the release of Bamisaye.  Bamisaye was on Wednesday kidnapped by seven gunmen on his farm located between Ero Dam and the Ekiti State farm settlement at Orin Ekiti, Ido/Osi Local Government Area of Ekiti State. The retiree was reportedly kidnapped around 4 pm. The development was said to have generated tension and panic among the residents, who are afraid it might soon be their turn to be kidnapped. “The seven gunmen had earlier attacked one man identified as Ojo within the vicinity of the farm where Bamisaye was kidnapped. “The man was asked about the whereabouts of the white men working at the farm settlement, but he replied that he didn’t know where they were. “They ordered him to lie face down. They ransacked his car that was parked nearby and took away a sum of N4,500 they found inside the vehicle.  “They fired a shot and terrified the environment before they later found the victim and whisked him away,” a source told WazobiaReporters.  The Commander of the Ekiti State Security Network Agency, known as Amotekun Corps, Joe Akomolafe, said the security agencies were already searching for the victim.  “We are already on top of the incident. The Amotekun Corps in collaboration with other security agencies are combing everywhere to rescue the man. “And let me also confirm that he (Bamisaye) was the only person abducted by the gunmen on his farm. We will surely get the perpetrators,” he said.
