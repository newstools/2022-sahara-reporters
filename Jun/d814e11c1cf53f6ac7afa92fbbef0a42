The Anambra State Governor, Chukwuma Soludo, has debunked reports making the rounds that a $20 million investment made by a former governor of the state, Peter Obi, is now worth $100 million.  Obi is the presidential candidate of the Labour Party in the 2023 general elections.  The investment was allegedly made in SABMiller Group.  A Facebook user had credited a statement to Soludo alleging that the $20 million which Obi allegedly invested on behalf of the state in the company is now worth $100 million.  “Mr Peter Obi’s $20 million investment in Anambra worth $100 million today - Charles Chukwuma Soludo,” the Facebook user had said.  Reacting to the claim on his verified Facebook page, Soludo said, “Where did you read or hear me make such false statement? This fake news has been roundly debunked by my team.  “We can carry on with campaigning for our preferred candidates without consciously misleading the reading public. The report is fake and never emanated from me. Thank you.”
