Members of the ruling All Progressives Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party in Imo North Senatorial zone of Imo State have collapsed their structures into the Labour Party.  They also pledged their loyalty and support for its presidential candidate and former governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi.  Over two thousand members of the two political parties reportedly joined the Labour Party in a ceremony at Umuaro community in the Isiala Mbano Local Government Area of the state.  Former Deputy Chief of Staff to a former governor of the state, Chikwem Onuoha, who spoke at the ceremony, on Sunday, said the decision was to ensure that Nigeria is rescued from its misrule which has put untold hardship on its citizens.  Onuoha said APC and PDP had misruled Nigeria for the past 23 years, and "we need someone to rescue it if we must progress as a nation."  The APC chieftain said, “Today, APC and PDP are dead in Okigwe zone. We have resolved to collapse our structures in the zone into the Labour Party and to work for the victory of Peter Obi. Peter Obi symbolises the hope of the ordinary people of Nigeria.  “Peter Obi is tested and trusted and he has the support of the people who vote during the election. Apart from Obi, we will vote LP all through. The Labour Party is for a mass movement. We are wiser and we want to take back our country.”  The President General of the Okigwe North Youth Progressives Forum, Chidinma Onyenagubo, said that his group was mobilising people to obtain Permanent Voter Cards to vote for LP in 2023.
