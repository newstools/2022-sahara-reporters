The boy asked them for the N100 change and they refused.“The boy asked them to balance the money; they told him he was mad, that they were police officers and shouldn’t have paid at all. So the boy went inside to meet his father and mother that the officers did not want to pay; as the woman came out, the officers started beating the small boy that he went to call his parents.“Before we know what was happening, one of them brought out a tear gas and released it on the woman. People gathered there to ask what happened, during that process, one of them brought out a knife and used it on the woman who just had an operation.”
