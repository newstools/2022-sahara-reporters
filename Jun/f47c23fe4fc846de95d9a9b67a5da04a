He alleged that the deceased were all from Tse Ibor village, just as he alleged that the settlement was taken over by suspected herders. The Chairman blamed militant herders for the killing of the duo occasioned by the consistent invasion of Tombo ward, a farming settlement, which had been under sustained attacks by gunmen suspected to be herders since 2016.
