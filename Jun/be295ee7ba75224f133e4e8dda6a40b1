The Presiding Bishop of the Living Faith Church Worldwide, David Oyedepo has taken a swipe at President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration. During a church programme, Special Prayer for The Nation, on Monday, Oyedepo said Buhari's government is the most corrupt in the history of Nigeria. David Oyedepo The clergyman who is a staunch critic of the current regime lamented the level of hardship Nigerians face, blaming it on corruption. According to Oyedepo, the Nigerian Government claims to be fighting corruption but its officials are corrupt. He said, “I shouted 2015 but I was a lone voice, prophets don't need anyone to support them, they say it as it is. The eyes of those technocrats and political juggernauts have seen it now... “Many children are out of school, there is nothing to pay to get them back to school. We saw some folks in Covenant University that we had to help out to graduate. First-class students can’t get N30,000 to pay under this wicked government, selfish, self-centred. “What a fight against corruption? You were all deceived, you can’t be in corruption and be fighting corruption. This is the most corrupt regime in the history of Nigeria. “You heard of Auditor General who stole N80 billion, all they need to get the university up and running is less than the N80 billion but they are not interested because their children are not there.”
