The Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Muhammed Bello, has said N1 billion will be spent to renovate the National Mosque and the National Christian Centre, both in Abuja.  Bello, who said he wants to make the National Mosque and the National Christian Centre presentable to tourists visiting Nigeria's capital, told the Presidential Communication Team on Thursday that the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) generates over N200 billion annually from its internally generated revenue (IGR).  Bello, while speaking at the weekly ministerial briefing at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, also claimed that the FCT has become the second-highest generator of internal revenue (IGR) after Lagos State in the country.  He said N500 million each had been set aside for the renovation project, adding that the administration was equally renovating the Federal Secretariat and National Assembly in which the sitting arrangements in the two chambers would be changed. The minister said the government was handling insecurity in Abuja city without creating “societal upheaval,” claiming that the FCT remained the most secure part of Nigeria despite the recent cases of killing and kidnapping in the city.  “For instance, we have, through the security measures busted several cells of Boko Haram within the FCT.  “Searching areas where they were and the kind of businesses they were doing and how they were able to blend easily within the wider community is something that I cannot divulge here," he said.  “Quite frankly, I am not aware that when street urchins are arrested, people seek their release. But more importantly, this is where citizens’ monitoring and engagement come in. I think if situations like these arise, it’s very important for people to speak out.  “Identify those influential people that try to pervert justice because that is the only way we can really sanitise our society. Whoever goes there to even seek bail must also be arrested, quite frankly,” he added.
