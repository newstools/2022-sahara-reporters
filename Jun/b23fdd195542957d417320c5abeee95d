Former Deputy Senate President, Senator Ike Ekweremadu has appeared before the Uxbridge Magistrate court in the UK over allegations of organ harvesting.  The Enugu West senator was arrested alongside his wife, Beatrice, last week by the London Metropolitan Police for allegedly conspiring to bring a child to the UK for organ harvesting.  The couple were tried at the Uxbridge Magistrates’ Court in London and denied bail as the prosecutors claimed that David Ukpo, the victim who alleged that he was coerced to donate his kidney to the Senator’s daughter, is said to be 15 years old.  However, there have been contrary claims that Ukpo is 21 years old.  They are both charged with conspiracy to arrange or facilitate the travel of another person with a view to exploitation, namely organ harvesting.  The case has been adjourned to July 7 at Westminster Magistrate Court to enable the UK Attorney General, Suella Braverman, to determine whether the case will be tried in the country or Nigeria.  Meanwhile, the Nigerian government through the High Commission to the United Kingdom has engaged lawyers to defend Ekweremadu, according to Senate President, Ahmad Lawan.
