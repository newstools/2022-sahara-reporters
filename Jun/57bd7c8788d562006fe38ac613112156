A UK parliamentary committee has set out the details of how it will investigate whether Prime Minister Boris Johnson misled parliament over COVID-19 lockdown breaking events at his Downing Street offices and residence. The Privileges Committee is said to look into whether Johnson, who earlier this month just survived a confidence vote brought by his Conservative lawmakers, misled parliament with his various comments on so-called partygate. Boris Johnson According to Reuters, if the committee finds he knowingly did mislead parliament, convention dictates he should offer his resignation. "Following its first meeting to consider the matter referred to it, the Committee is calling for evidence submissions and accounts from those with knowledge of events related to the inquiry," a House of Commons statement said. Veteran opposition Labour Party lawmaker Harriet Harman would chair the committee during its inquiry. Those who wish to submit evidence would have until July 29 to do so, the committee said. The oral evidence sessions would begin in the autumn, and it would also be willing to take oral or written evidence from people who wish to remain anonymous, the committee said.
