The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Abdullahi Adamu, may be heading for implosion following his botched consensus declaration of Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, as the preferred presidential candidate of the party.Following the development, a group, Buhari Support Group, has asked Adamu to step down from his position, adding that he is no longer seen as an unbiased umpire. SaharaReporters had reported that Adamu had announced the Senate President as the APC presidential consensus candidate.The development was reported to have immediately triggered reactions from within and outside the party.But the BSG in statement signed by Ahmed Bashir, condemned Adamu’s treacherous position while insisting that he could not conduct or supervise the party primary for which he had already announced what they termed a “fake” result even before the commencement of the process.The group called on the National Working Committee to rise to the occasion and save the party from implosion by suspending Abdullahi Adamu if he fails to withdraw himself from conducting the presidential primary.Bashir commended President Buhari for dissociating himself from what they called the sham consensus candidate announced by Adamu.They said Adamu’s action, using the name of President Muhammadu Buhari, had not only caused the president a national disgrace but also an international embarrassment.The statement partly read, “The Buhari Support Group has been vindicated by the position of President Muhammadu Buhari that he has not endorsed any consensus candidate for the position of Presidential Candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC).“The purported adoption of a consensus candidate by the party chairman, Senator Abdulahi Adamu, using the name of President Buhari, has not only caused Mr. President a national disgrace but also international embarrassment. It is commendable that Mr. President has instantly disassociated himself from the sham consensus candidate announced by Senator Adamu, which has caused serious disagreement in the party’s National Working Committee.“In view of the above, it is our position that Senator Abdulahi Adamu should step down forthwith as the Chairman of the party as he is no longer seen as an unbiased umpire and therefore unable to conduct, coordinate, supervise and oversee the presidential primary election, for which he has announced a fake result even before the commencement of accreditation.“We call on the members of the National Working Committee to rise up to the occasion and save our party from implosion, by suspending Senator Adamu till after the convention, if he fails to immediately recuse himself from conducting the presidential primary election."
