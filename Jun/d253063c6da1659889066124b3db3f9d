The Nigerian Army has said two members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and its militant wing, Eastern Security Network (ESN) were injured by an explosive device they had planted on the road. Director, Army Public Relations, Brig.-Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu on Thursday said IPOB/ESN members had buried explosive devices along different routes in the troubled South-East region. This, he said, was done to harm Nigerian troops.  He said while trying to escape an attack by Nigerian troops, the devices exploded and wounded some of the IPOB members. IPOB is a secessionist group led by Nnamdi Kanu, who is currently under detention while standing trial for alleged terrorism and other related offences. The group seeks the breakaway of the South-East region, and possibly the South-South which is to be known as the Biafra Republic. According to the army spokesman, the incident occurred on Wednesday, June 1, 2022, along Eke Ututu–Orsu Road in Orsu Local Government Area of Imo. Nwachukwu urged residents to inform troops of possible areas where the explosives have been buried for proper evacuation and disposal.  He said, “The dissidents inadvertently stepped on the IED which they had earlier planted along several routes in Orlu, Orsu Local Government Area, while they were attempting to evade troops’ onslaught against terrorists in the area.  “The outlawed group has severally planted IEDs along troops’ patrol routes in a failed effort to bring harm to the troops.  “We urge all peace-loving people of the South-East to please inform troops of possible areas where these explosives have been buried for proper evacuation and disposal.”
