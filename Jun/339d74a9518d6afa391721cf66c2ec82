A former Federal Lawmaker and a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party in Kogi State, Dino Melaye, has lambasted the Presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, saying he is not mentally and physically fit to lead Nigeria.Melaye speaking on an interview on Channels TV on Monday evening said the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, “was playing football three to four days ago” while challenging Tinubu to go and do same to prove if he was healthy as claimed. The former lawmaker, who recently lost another senatorial election, said, “For us in the PDP, we have asked Atiku to put together his acceptance speech because he’s the next president of federal republic of Nigeria; Bola Tinubu with his inordinate ambition, capricious manifestation and reaction formation is no match. Bola Tinubu is a baby weight compared to Atiku Abubakar.“In all ramifications, politically, mentally, physically, medically, socially and even religiously, Bola Tinubu and Atiku Abubakar’s political popularity are not on the same page, how can Tinubu be bigger than Atiku?“In terms of political experience, you cannot say Bola Tinubu and Atiku on the same page, Atiku in 1992 stepped down for MKO Abiola, Abubakar by the virtue of being the Vice President of this country has a political edge in terms of experience.“It is not possible that a sound, intellectually and physically fit Atiku be compared with Tinubu. Atiku was playing football three to four days ago; ask the candidate of APC to go and do same thing. You have to be mentally and physically fit to be president of Nigeria.“You have the flag bearer of the APC who cannot even lift a flag.” He further stated that no sane Nigeria would vote for the APC.Speaking on the Buhari-led administration which he described as a failure, Melaye urged the president to take Nigerians back to 2014.“We are in a situation that's near to surrendering to God Almighty alone and we have a government without governance; we are in a democracy where the president has lost control, where the president from his expression and narrative has shown that he’s incapacitated; the security situation is not in any way showing any drive towards ameliorating the situation.“We have never had leadership failure like this ever; not even in Sudan or Liberia do they have this quantum of leadership failure and it is at all levels. The APC has failed Nigerians; they have invited chaos, banditry, kidnapping; we are just in a sorry state as a nation,” he added.
