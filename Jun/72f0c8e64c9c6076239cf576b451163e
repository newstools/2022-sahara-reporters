The Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide has appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to release Nnamdi Kanu, in order to reduce the tension in the South-East region. The apex Igbo body made the request in a statement issued by the President-General of the organisation, George Obiozor, while conveying its goodwill message to President Muhammadu Buhari over the ongoing All Progressives Congress (APC) Convention.
