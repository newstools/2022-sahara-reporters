The Anglican Communion Bishop of Jebba Diocese, Rt Rev Oluwaseun Aderogba and his wife have reportedly been kidnapped by terrorists.  According to New Telegraph, they were abducted on Sunday evening along Ogbomoso-Oyo Road.  The Bishop’s Chaplain who was with the victims narrated how he escaped from the ambush.  He said, “We were travelling from Jebba to Oyo, when it was a few kilometres to Oyo, our vehicle developed a fault. My Lord bishop called the Lord bishop of Oyo Bishop Aladekugbe for help.  “However, before help could come, some armed men surrounded and ordered them into the bush. I was lucky. They didn’t see me because of my black cassock.  “I fell flat on my belly to hide myself while they marched my bishop and wife deep into the forest.”  Bishop Aladekugbe reportedly alerted the leadership of the church, Most Revd Henry Ndukuba and other members of the house of bishops.  After some hours, the abductors got in touch with the church through the wife of the bishop, who was able to speak for a few seconds.  They demanded N50m ransom before they would release the duo.  As of 11.35 pm Sunday, negotiations were still ongoing.
