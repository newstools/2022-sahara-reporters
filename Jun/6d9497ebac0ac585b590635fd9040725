A Magistrate Court sitting in Gusau, Zamfara State capital, has remanded a former deputy Chief of Staff to Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara, Bashir Mohammed Maru, and four others over misappropriation of an official Hilux vehicle.The defendants were charged with criminal conspiracy and misappropriation of a public vehicle given to the former deputy Chief of Staff while in service. The other four defendants are; Isah Usman, Shuiabu Musa, Yusuf Bello, and Mallam Yazid.But it was only the first accused person, Isah Usman, and the second accused person who appeared in court and pleaded not guilty to the two offences for which they were being accused.The remaining persons were not yet to be arrested by the police. The state counsel, Mohammed Aminu, told newsmen after the trial that the Zamfara State Government had asked the court to adjourn the matter to a later date to enable the police to conduct further investigation and apprehend the three fleeing suspects who were at large.But the counsel to the first accused challenged the plea of the state counsel. He noted that the state’s Attorney General had taken over the matter from the Nigerian police and therefore should be conversant with the matter in question.He further asserted that the Chief Magistrate Court 1 did not have the power to grant the application and to sit over the case, urging the court to reject the application and transfer the matter to a sharia court of competence jurisdiction given the fact the accused persons professed Islamic faith.Meanwhile, the presiding magistrate, Magistrate Sa’adu Garba ruled as follows;He said, “I would not waste my time, taking into cognizance of the Zamfara State law number 7 and the court with greater power that can handle this kind of matter is the State’s high court and for that reason.“The matter shall be referred to the Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice to transfer to the State’s high court.”He, therefore, ordered that the two accused persons be remanded in the correctional facility to appear in the higher court.The court will consider the application for a bail of the two accused persons brought to court at a date to be communicated to both parties on the matter.
