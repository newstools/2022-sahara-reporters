The Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) rose from its National Executive meeting in Enugu State on Thursday, resolving that it would participate fully in the 2023 general elections regardless of its agitation for separate country.MASSOB in the meeting which was presided over by Uchenna Madu, its leader, advised the members of other pro-Biafra groups and South-Easterners in general to register and secure their permanent voter's cards (PVCs) to enable them remove their oppressors and tyrannical leaders from the federal to state government levels.

The resolution of the meeting circulated in Enugu, which was signed by MASSOB's National Director of Information Samuel Edeson, said their stand became necessary because "a stitch in time saves nine.”The five points’ communique reads, "That though MASSOB quest for Biafra actualisation and restoration can never be abandoned or jeopardized, our belief for Biafra is infallible and unshakable. We advise the oppressed, abandoned, deprived and mesmerised youths, women, men and students to secure their PVCs to enable them remove their oppressors and tyrannical leaders from the federal to state governments."That MASSOB warns that 2023 general election must be peaceful, fair and credible. That INEC must maintain the independency of their name in discharging their electoral duties."On the killing of their members and dumping their corpses at Ezu River, MASSOB absorbed former Anambra Governor, Peter Obi, of any involvement.It said, "That MASSOB expresses surprise that one Simon Ekpa that is based in Finland will use the instrument of social media to distort the open truth about Ezu river killings of MASSOB members.“Members of MASSOB were arrested by the defunct SARS in Anambra State led by James Nwafor, a notorious policeman. He later killed them alongside other suspected criminals and dumped their bodies at Ezu river, Amansea Awka."MASSOB advises distorters of truth and paid agents of destructions to stop attaching Mr Peter Obi's name to Ezu river killings, he did not order or supervised the arrest and subsequent gruesome killing of MASSOB members."On the issue of members and other pro-Biafra groups held captive in Nigeria detention camps, the separatist group urged the Federal Government to release them, adding that no amount of intimidation would stop their Biafra struggle."That MASSOB demands for the release of our members, IPOB members and other members of pro Biafra agitators from Nigerian police cells and prisons."That MASSOB shows solidarity to the detained leader of IPOB, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. Arrest and detentions does not break the spirit of Biafra in us. The continuous detaining of our brother, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and rigmaroling of his court processes will never break him or jeopardise our quest for Biafra actualisation and restoration."
