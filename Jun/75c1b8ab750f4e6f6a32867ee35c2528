Scores of protesters stormed the national secretariat of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abuja on Friday, requesting the party to choose former President Goodluck Jonathan as its presidential candidate for the 2023 election. The protesters in a video seen by SaharaReporters displayed banners with inscriptions like, 'Goodluck On Your Mandate We Stand'.  SaharaReporters had earlier reported how Jonathan, who was President on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), was conspicuously absent on Saturday as the party members gathered at the Moshood Abiola Stadium in Abuja to elect its 2023 presidential candidate. Even though his name and picture were on the convention programme, the ex-president was not seen at the venue. Jonathan was president between 2010 and 2015 before he was defeated by President Muhammadu Buhari of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). But in the last few years, the former president has distanced himself from the various activities of the party.SaharaReporters had reported how the former president was being prepared by the APC cabal and Buhari’s kitchen cabinet as the APC's 2023 consensus candidate
