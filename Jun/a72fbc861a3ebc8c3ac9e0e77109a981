The Senator representing Kwara Central at the National Assembly, Dr. Ibrahim Yahaya Oloriegbe has disclosed that some delegates were forced to swear an oath before they were allowed to vote during the ruling All Progressive Congress primaries in Kwara State. Senator Oloriegbe made this known while appearing on a Channels Television programme, Sunrise Daily monitored by SaharaReporters on Wednesday. He said, "Like in Kwara State, Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq just sat down with a few of his people one night and they produced a supposed delegates’ list for the whole state. "The aspirants didn't even know the delegates, they changed them at will. Thus, they only selected those that would take instructions from them, in some instances some even took oaths," he said. SaharaReporters earlier reported that Senator Oloriegbe admitted to bribing delegates during party primaries. See Also
