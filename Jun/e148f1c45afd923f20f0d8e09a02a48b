Members of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN), popularly known as Shi'ites have condemned the alleged persecution and attack on Muslims by Indian authorities, describing it as unacceptable.In a letter dated June 17, 2022, issued by Dr. Dauda Nalado on behalf of the Academic Forum of the Movement and addressed to the Indian High Commissioner to Nigeria, the IMN warned the Indian government against all forms of discrimination against Muslims in the country. The group told the Indian government that making derogatory remarks against people’s beliefs and religious personalities is not freedom of speech, but rather an "immoral comportment and a crime capable of inciting hatred and violence across the globe".IMN pointed out that disrespecting Islam and Muslims in India is tantamount todisrespecting Islam and Muslims in Nigeria and across the globe. The letter read in part, "On behalf of the Academic Forum of the Islamic Movement under the leadership of his eminence, Sheikh Ibraheem Ya’qoub El-Zakzaky (H); we write to protest against the ongoing persecution of Muslims in India by the Indian authority."The news reaching us here in Nigeria through mainstream and social media revealed that Muslims are systematically being attacked by Indian security agents through unlawful arrest, detention, and demolition of houses as a result of their action and reaction concerning a derogatory remark made on Islam. "We would like to draw the attention of the Indian Government that derogatory remarks on people’s beliefs and religious personality can never be considered as freedom of speech, but rather an immoral comportment and a crime capable of inciting hatred and violence across the globe."Islam respects human beings irrespective of their beliefs. Qur’an (6: 108) Allah (Ta'ala) says: And do not insult those whom they worship besides Allah, lest they insult Allah wrongfully without knowledge."It is pertinent to inform the Indian High Commissioner to Nigeria that disrespecting Islam and Muslims in India is also disrespecting Islam and Muslims in Nigeria and across the globe. We, therefore, demand the end of derogatory remarks on Islam and attacks on Muslims in India."We also demand the end of lynching and all forms of discrimination against Muslims in India. We would continue to study this situation and demand justice for Muslims in India."
