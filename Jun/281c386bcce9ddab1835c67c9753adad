Community sources accused the neighbouring Agila in Ado local government area of Benue State of being behind the unprovoked attacks and killings.One of the sources said, “The gunmen were many, and they were shooting sporadically. People ran helter skelter. In the end, many persons were reported dead while some were declared missing. It was discovered that the attackers abducted some of the people“I can’t confirm any figure now, but that will be settled before the end of today” he said.Meanwhile, SaharaReporters gathered that the community had been in conflict with Agila over boundary disputes.The Chairman of Ohaukwu local government area, Omekannaya Odah, who confirmed the attack, said security had been deployed to the affected community.Odah in a statement said “Ohaukwu Local Government Council has received with concern, reports of the security breaches and attack against the innocent people of Ojiogu and Okpochiri Ukwagba Ngbo on Monday, June 27, 2022."The council condemns the incident in the strongest terms and reassures all that no stones will be left unturned to unravel the true circumstances that led to such unwarranted attack and loss of lives and properties."Council has liaised with appropriate security agencies to immediately move into the troubled areas while working assiduously with the relevant stakeholders with a view to ensure a quick return of peace and normalcy to Ukwagba.”Efforts to get the police reaction were unsuccessful as the command's spokesman, Chris Anyanwu, did not pick his calls at the time of filling this report.
