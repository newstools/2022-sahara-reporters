The Islamic State-backed faction of Boko Haram, the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), formerly known as Jamā'at Ahl as-Sunnah lid-Da'wah wa'l-Jihād says it attacked two Nigerian government vehicles in the Adavi Local Government Area of Kogi State. The attack was the fifth to be claimed by the group in the state in the last two months.  ISWAP in a statement said two Nigerian government vehicles were burnt by “soldiers of the caliphate and then returned to their positions”. On April 23, gunmen attacked a police station in the same Adavi LGA in the state, which resulted in the death of three police officers. Some days later, ISWAP claimed responsibility for the attack. On May 11, there was an explosion at a bar in Lewu Junction area of Kabba town, Kogi. The explosion claimed three lives out of the 16 persons affected. Two weeks later, another explosion occurred at another bar in the town, in Kabbah-Bunu LGA. The group claimed responsibility for both explosions Kabba is the headquarters of the Kabba/Bunnu LGA and the people speak a dialect of Yoruba called Owe. The town is less than 10 minutes to Akunnu-Akoko and Ajowa-Akoko in Ondo State and less than 20 minutes to Omuo in Ekiti State. ISWAP in June also claimed responsibility for the explosion that led to the death of two persons during an annual festival in the Idoji area of Okene, Kogi State.
