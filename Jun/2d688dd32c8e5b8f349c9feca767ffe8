Shehu Sani He wrote, “The President boringly maintained ministers for seven years. He found it difficult to replace or reshuffle his appointees. “He extended the tenure of non-performing service chiefs and public officers who completed their terms.” Sani said Buhari inherited, kept and reappointed a Central Bank of Nigeria Governor, adding that he could also not appoint Board members for many federal parastatals for seven years. The former lawmaker noted that Buhari was also indecisive and “incoherent in choosing a successor and firmly standing by him.” “The nation, the government and now the future slipped off his hands before his very eyes.”
