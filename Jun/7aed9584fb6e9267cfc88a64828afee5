The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has warned officers of the Nigerian Army and the Nigeria Police Force over alleged plans to embark on a house-to-house search for local guns in Obowu, Achingali in Mbaise, Mbano, Ihite Uboma local government areas of Imo State.IPOB, in a statement issued by Emma Powerful, alleged that police officers and soldiers had surrounded the aforementioned areas in preparation for the raid. The group said it gathered that some soldiers were currently being camped at Otoko police station, and in collaboration with vigilantes and other “traitors and saboteurs” will start a house raid to collect farmers’ dane-guns made for self defence.The statement said, “We raise the alarm over secret genocide the Nigerian Army and its sister security agencies wish to embark on against the innocent citizens of Obowu LGA, Achingali in Mbaise, Mbano LGAs, Ihite Uboma LGA of Imo State.“These communities and local government areas were circled by the Nigerian army and police to start their unlawful action, we raise alarm to the public, men and women of good conscience across the globe to prevail on the Nigerian Government and its compromised security agents to leave the Biafra territory alone and face Fulani terrorists masquerading as herdsmen who are raping mothers and women in the North.“The information contained in our knowledge indicated that the Nigerian Army and police have been deployed to these communities and areas embarking on house-to-house searching to mop up Hunter's guns and personal objects people use for their security, mostly single and double barrels being used for hunting games and for self defence from dangerous animals called themselves terrorists as the government agencies care less about their safety.“This move further confirms our yelling over the deliberate attempt to wipe Biafrans out for Fulani to occupy our ancestral lands,“The Nigerian Army is now camped at Otoko police station, from where they will perfect their wicked operational plans with the conscripted local vigilantes and other bought overs as "ndi osuimi" that is traitors and sabotures in our midst and then move house-to-house encircled for collection of farmers den-guns made for self defence. Meanwhile, terrorist herdsmen move around with not just AK-47, AK-49, but now with Travor "Tar-21" of which only the Nigerian government was licensed and authorised to use.“We want to make it clear to the Nigerian government and its security agents that we want a peaceful referendum. We want Mazi Nnamdi Kanu's immediate and unconditional release.“We want the military and police to stop impoverishing our people by way of ransom collection which is being shared up to their highest command.”
