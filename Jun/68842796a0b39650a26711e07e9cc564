The Nigerian Senate on Wednesday said it would send a high-powered delegation to meet with Senator Ike Ekweremadu in London, United Kingdom.The decision was after the lawmakers met behind closed doors for two hours on Wednesday, a series of tweets from the senate verified Twitter page read. The Enugu West senator was arrested alongside his wife, Beatrice, last week by the London Metropolitan Police for allegedly conspiring to bring a child to the UK for organ harvesting.The couple were tried at the Uxbridge Magistrates’ Court in London and denied bail as the prosecutors reportedly informed the court that Ekweremadu procured a passport for the boy and claimed he was 21 years old only to discover that he was 15 years old.“The High Commission has also been able to provide some consular services that included the engagement of lawyers who defend our colleague. We commend them for doing this particular issue at stake,” Senate President, Dr. Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan was quoted as saying."Equally, the British, the Nigerian Ministers of Foreign Affairs have been engaged here so that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs extends diplomatic support for our colleague because this issue is already in court.“We have limited opportunity to discuss beyond what we have done so far. But I want to assure the family of our colleague and Nigerians that the Senate will continue to engage with our Ministry of Foreign Affairs as well as the Nigerian High Commission in London."The High Commission has done so much but we still expect that it will continue to provide consular service. And we have also mandated our Committee on Foreign Affairs to engage with the British Commission here in Nigeria to find more details on this case as far as the High delegation is involved. There will be a delegation to London to see the former Deputy Senate President."A delegation from the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs will leave in the next two days to London for that purpose.”
