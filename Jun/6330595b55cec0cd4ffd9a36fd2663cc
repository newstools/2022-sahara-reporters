The Nigerian Army authorities have approved the rotation of over 100 soldiers fighting insurgency in the Northeast.  SaharaReporters had exclusively reported the lamentations of the soldiers who had overstayed their mission in the region and were prevented from taking any break for nearly five years.  They complained that their low morale and lack of willingness to continue to fight made it possible for terrorists to dislodge some military camps recently.  They said they were not sure why army commanders had refused to send those expected to relieve them to the battlefield three months after they were due for rotation.  In a letter titled ‘ROTATION PLAN OF OVERSTAYED NACST PERSONNEL OF HADIN KAI PHASE X 79NA/31888 WO BUKA JUMBO - DVR B1 AND 100 OTHERS’, the army authorities directed their release and transportation to “AHQ Gar ST Bde, Sect 2 ST Bde on 21 June unfailingly.”  The letter read, “References A conveyed list of overstayed NACST personnel in Op HADIN KAI Rotation Plan Phase X and their replacement to AHQ DAOP’s fir scheduled date of de-induction/induction. “According, Reference B requested AHQ NAOMT to coordinate their de-induction/Induction.
