There is palpable fear in Furfuri town in the Bungudu Local Government Area of Zamfara State after armed terrorists invaded the town in the late hours of Sunday and kidnapped 23 persons. The victims included two wives and three children of a former Accountant-General of the state, Abubakar Bello Furfuri.  A source from Furfuri town identified as Mallam Sani, confirmed the incident to Nigerian Tribune. The town is said to be just 7 kilometres away from Gusau, the state capital. “In one of the houses they invaded, they whisked away many people,” Sani said. However, Sani said military operatives were deployed to the town immediately. “Two Hilux vans loaded with soldiers were deployed in the village but before they arrived, the bandits had left,” the source said. The Zamfara State Police Public Relations Officer, SP Shehu Mohammed, who also confirmed the incident, said that police operatives had been deployed to rescue the victims. Meanwhile, Mohammed noted that as a result of intensified efforts by security operatives, some of the abductees were rescued immediately while efforts were on to rescue the rest.
