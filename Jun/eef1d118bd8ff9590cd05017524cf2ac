The presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Mr Peter Obi, has expressed support for the former Deputy President of Senate, Ike Ekweremadu over allegations of child trafficking and an attempt to harvest the kidney of a minor. The former Anambra governor took to his Twitter handle @PeterObi to share his support for the family and pray for the healing of their daughter.  SaharaReporters had reported on Thursday, that Ekweremadu and his wife, Beatrice were arrested at Heathrow airport, London and arraigned in court for allegedly plotting to harvest the kidney of a Nigerian minor.  The duo who were reported to be attempting to harvest the organ of a Nigerian minor to save the life of their daughter, Sonia, pleaded not guilty to the charges at the Uxbridge Magistrates’ Court.  Magistrate Lois Sheard, despite their plea for bail since their passports were with the police, remanded both defendants in custody ahead of their hearing on July 7th.  My family and I are with the Ekweremaduâs over their travail. We join all men of goodwill in praying for the healing of their daughter and commit them into Godâs hand for justice to be done. -PO  However, the Nigerian lawmaker denied the allegations of organ harvesting, while sharing a letter to the UK High Commission in Nigeria, requesting a visa for the alleged minor.  Obi's tweet read: “My family and I are with the Ekweremadus over their travail.  “We join all men of goodwill in praying for the healing of their daughter and commit them into God’s hand for justice to be done.”
