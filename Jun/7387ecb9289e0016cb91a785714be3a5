A Delta State indigene staying in Borno State, Napoleon Efetobor, has cried out that his building in Maiduguri, the state capital, was demolished by government officials without a demolition notice. Efetobor told SaharaReporters that he was in his shop when his neighbour called him that his house located at Moduganari Byepass was being demolished.  He said he had been living in the state for the past 32 years and shouldn’t have been rewarded like that. According to Efetobor, he bought the land in 2018 from a man called Ba'adam. “I really feel bad, I bought the land in 2018 from a man called Ba'adam, I then started building the following year. During the roofing stage in 2019, some people came from the state government and marked the house and I protested why, so they came back in two to three months and said they were sorry and can continue with my building. “So, I finished everything except painting in February 2021, I was in my shop recently with one of my customers when they called me on the phone to come as my house was being demolished. “So, I left what I was doing and rushed to see my house had been demolished, I feel bad cause all my efforts to finish the building are all in vain. All I want from the government is for them to compensate me. I shouldn’t be repaid with this for all the years spent here in Borno.”
