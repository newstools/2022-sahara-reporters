Femi Adesina, the Special Adviser to the President on Media, has attacked the General Overseer of the Living Faith Church, popularly known as Winners Chapel, Bishop David Oyedepo for describing President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration as the most corrupt in Nigeria’s history. Oyedepo had while speaking during a recent programme in his church lamented the level of hardship in the country, attributing it to corruption.  He had said the N80 billion allegedly stolen by the Accountant-General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris, would be enough to meet the demands of the striking university lecturers, Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU. The industrial action has grounded public universities for four months. “Everything causing heaviness to people is attached to vengeance. Many children are out of school, there is nothing to pay to get them back to school. We saw some folks in Covenant University that we had to help out to graduate. First-class students can’t get N30,000 to pay under this wicked, selfish, self-centred government,” the cleric had claimed. “What a fight against corruption? You were all deceived. You can’t be in corruption and be fighting corruption. The most corrupt regime in the history of Nigeria. “You heard of the Auditor General… N80 billion. All they need to get the university up and running is less than the N80 billion but they are not interested because their children are not there. “Thank you, Jesus, God has a reason, the light shall be liberated. The nation shall be recused in the name of Jesus.” Reacting in a tweet on Tuesday, Adesina claimed Oyedepo didn’t get his facts right as he has been blinded by hatred for Buhari. “The bishop at Ota can’t even get his facts right. Blinded by hatred for PMB, he says Auditor General stole N80bn. Pity! “He doesn’t know difference between Accountant General (only alleged) and Auditor General. Like OBJ said long ago, we should begin to ordain our own bishops,” he tweeted.
