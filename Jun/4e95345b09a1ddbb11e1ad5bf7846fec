The former Dean of Law, University of Nigeria and former United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Trafficking Professor Joy Ezeilo, has decried the rising inflation in Nigeria.  Ezeilo, who is the founder, Women Aid Collective (WACOL) and Tamar Sexual Assault Referral Centre and the West African Women’s Rights Coalition (WAWORC), took to her verified Twitter handle Prof. Joy Ngozi Ezeilo (OON) @NgoziEzeilo to lament the worsening inflation across the country.  She expressed worry about how Nigerians would survive the unfolding hardship.  She said, "We're in troubled waters with crippling inflation."  She disclosed that as a law professor that has reached the last step and stage in promotion at a Federal University, she is paid about N400,000 per month after taxes. After buying 50 litres of diesel at N40,000 to fuel her car for the week, she lamented that by the end of the month, she would have spent 40 per cent of her salary to go to work.  SaharaReporters had reported that the umbrella body of lecturers in public universities, the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has been on strike since February 14, 2022, to demand among other things that their welfare should be improved. The strike has lasted about 120 days yet the Nigerian government has failed to resolve the issues so public universities can reopen.  Her series of tweets which have attracted 5,966 retweets, 559 comments and 18,300 likes, read, "Which way is Nigeria headed?

"What about other utilities, electricity, water, rent, food, children’s school fees, medical, phone and internet etc.  "Cooking gas is up by over 200 percent? Do we resort to firewood?
