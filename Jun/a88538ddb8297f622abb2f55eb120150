In attempt to arrest the criminals, six out of the seven gang member escaped and abandoned both the victim’s vehicle and their operational vehicle. The seventh person, arrested was lynched by an angry mob and set ablaze before police operatives could arrive at the scene.“Consequently, the Commissioner of Police CP Echeng while condemning the act of mob action by some members of the public who resort to jungle justice whenever they arrest suspects in respect of criminal allegations without recourse to the Police for proper investigation.“Echeng also urged them to always exercise restraint by not taking the law into their hands. They should endeavour to take such suspects to the nearest Police Station whenever they are apprehended. This would afford the Police the opportunity to conduct appropriate investigation into the nefarious activities of the suspects; and bring them to justice in accordance with extant laws.“Meanwhile, police operatives have initiated an operation aimed at arresting the fleeing gang members and suspects who took laws into their hands by setting ablaze the arrested suspect.”
