The Senate Leader and former All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship aspirant in Kebbi State, Senator Yahaya Abdullahi has defected from the ruling All progressives Congress APC to join the opposition party, Peoples Democratic Party, PDP.This was announced by his special adviser on media and publicity Muhammad Jamil Gulma.  He said, “Senate Leader Dr Yahaya Abdullahi will on Wednesday by 9 am leave Abuja for Kebbi and proceed to Kamba local government to formally declare for PDP and to possibly indicate his interest to contest his present seat.”Recall that Dr Yahaya was a frontline in the APC’s Kebbi governorship primaries. But he could not secure the ticket having had zero votes, a result which he had since rejected and described as shambolic and a child’s play.Senator Yahaya lost the ticket to Governor Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State, who had 455 votes to be the winner of the election.Hence, there have been speculations that his defection may be related to the governorship primaries and several allegations of misuse of power by the national leadership of the ruling APC.
