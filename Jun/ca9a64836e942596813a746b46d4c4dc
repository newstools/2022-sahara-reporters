The Edo State High Court sitting in Benin, the state capital has granted bail to the comedian and vlogger, Chukwu Michael Emeka, arrested by Nigeria’s secret police, Department of State Services (DSS). His lawyer, Matthew Osa-Oghogho, confirmed that the comedian, popularly known as Broda Mike, had been released in a post on his Facebook page on Tuesday, saying, “Today, the High Court of justice sitting in Benin released Comedian Emeka Chukwu Aka #BrotherMike to bail. He was arrested by the Department of State Services and accused of inciting the Public.  "The court agreed with our submission that the application for the remand of Mr. Chukwu is unmeritorious and therefore admitted him to bail. We stand for justice always and at all times!” The lawyer also posted a picture of himself and the comedian. The DSS arrested the comedian on June 14, 2022, accusing him of inciting the public. The comedian had been using comedy skits to talk about issues affecting Nigerians including poor governance and insecurity. Reacting to his release, human rights activist and presidential candidate of the African Action Congress, Omoyele Sowore, tweeted, “BREAKING #BrodaMike granted bail: Glad to announce that lawless DSS was handed defeated in court today as I’ve argued, yesterday they were grandstanding that they have a valid detention order to keep #BrodaMike detained. “It was all a ruse and a court in Edo state (presumably the court they obtained the fraudulent order from) has reversed itself and granted #BrodaMike bail. “A lawyer Matthew Osa-oghogho handled this case brilliantly. It is another day that gladdens the spirit of relentless struggle for social justice in Nigeria and a defeat of tyranny. #Welcome Back #BrodaMike. “Great job @Matthew Osa-Oghogho.”
