A yet-to-be-identified Nigerian Army Officer has reportedly shot a young boy, who is identified as a fuel attendant at Ashafa Filling Station near Obasanjo Shopping Complex, Minna, Niger State. The soldier was said to have shot the fuel attendant in Minna after he was stabbed by the boy.





SaharaReporters could not confirm if the fuel attendant was killed or not. When SaharaReporters contacted the state police spokesman, Abiodun Wasiu, to get more details on the incident, he said, "I will call you back."He had not got to back to SaharaReporters at the time of filing this report. In another development, an armed robbery gang on Sunday reportedly robbed a filling station of N1.8 million. One of the robbers was caught by soldiers while the gang was trying to escape.It was gathered that the soldiers were driving along Agbani Road in Enugu State metropolis when they saw the armed robbery suspects and went after them. They caught one of them whose identity could not be ascertained at the time of filing this report. A viral video of the incident which SaharaReporters saw on Monday, shows the suspect's hands were bound behind his back by the soldiers.A voice could be heard in the video saying that the suspect was one of the members of the gang that robbed the filling station.The person speaking in the video said, "A staff of the filling station, Pinnacle Oil, Agbani Road was waiting for 'Keke' (commercial tricycle) in front of the station with a bag containing N1.8m, which she was taking to the bank."In what appeared like a movie, gun-wielding hoodlums jumped out of a minibus and snatched the money."As they tried to escape, the unfortunate robber was caught with the help of soldiers who were just driving past."SaharaReporters, however, could not verify whether the suspect was handed over to the police or later killed, as the soldiers reportedly shot him in the leg.
