This caused a commotion in the club.  “It was learnt that Burna Boy and his crew then drove off to one of his properties at the Elegushi end of the Lekki-Epe Expressway before leaving for Lekki Phase 1.“Aware of what he had done, Burna Boy took the next flight out without even informing the policemen.
