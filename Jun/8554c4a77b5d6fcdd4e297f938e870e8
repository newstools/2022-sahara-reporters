Ahead of the 2023 general elections, a Nigerian law firm, Antonio Lex Firma, has threatened to enforce a policy of ‘No Permanent Voter Card (PVC), No payment of staff salary’. The firm made this known in an internal memo signed by its secretary, Nkechi Duru and sent to staff members.  According to the letter dated June 8, the principal partner of the firm, Barr. A. K Agbasiere, declared Thursday, June 9 and Friday, June 10 as work-free days to allow all employees who do not have PVCs to get theirs. The letter read, “I am directed by the Principal Partner of Antonio Lex Firma, Barr. A. K Agbasiere (KSJI) to inform all the staff of the firm and his domestic staff that 9th and 10th of June, 2022, will be Work Free Day. This is to enable all the staff to go and register and get their PVC. “Consequently, anyone without PVC will henceforth NOT receive salary.” As political processes preceding the 2023 general elections continue to heighten, private and public organisations including religious organisations have intensified campaigns for their staff and members to get their PVCs in order to enable them to exercise their civic responsibility.
