A Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has ruled against the application by the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, seeking an order discharging the earlier order revoking his bail.Kanu was brought to court on Tuesday by operatives of the Department of State Services, DSS as security agents initially prevented journalists from gaining access to the courtroom. The IPOB leader is facing trial before Justice Binta Nyako-led court for charges bordering on terrorism.In its ruling on Tuesday, the court held that Kanu has not provided sufficient reasons to warrant the court to set aside its order.The presiding judge, Justice Binta Nyako, dismissed the application, stating that it was an abuse of the court process.The court held that the fresh bail application filed by Kanu was an attempt to force the court to litigate on an issue that had already been dispensed of.However, Justice Nyako advised Kanu to seek redress at the appellate Court if he felt otherwise.In the application which was filed by his lead counsel, Chief Mike Ozekhome, SAN, Kanu prayed for an order setting aside the order made on March 28, 2019, directing for his arrest and continuation of his trial in absentia.Justice Nyako had, on March 28, 2019, revoked the bail Kanu, ordered his arrest and directed that his trial should continue in his absence.Nyako ruled that the court gave the order because Kanu failed to appear in court after his bail was granted on April 25, 2017, and this followed an application by the prosecution.Kanu has been in the detention of the DSS since he was arrested in June 2021. He has been “abducted” in Kenya and repatriated to Nigeria.
