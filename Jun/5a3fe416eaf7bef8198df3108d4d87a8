The All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) National Chairman, Senator Victor Umeh, has dumped the party after failing to secure a ticket to go to Senate for the Anambra Central senatorial District in 2023. Senator Umeh had lost the APGA senatorial ticket to the incumbent Member of House of Representatives representing Anaocha/ Dunukofia/Njikoka Federal Constituency, Hon. Dozie Nwankwo, after scoring 151 votes against Nwankwo who polled 162 votes.  Umeh on Thursday joined the Labour Party (LP), in Awka, the Anambra State capital where he picked expression of interest and nomination form for the Anambra Central Senatorial District as primaries of the party were still going on. The former APGA boss, if nominated by the party, would be contesting against Senator Uche Ekwunife of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dozie Nwankwo of his former party, APGA and Chief Kodilichukwu Okelekwe of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2023. Senator Umeh is second top politician in Anambra State, particularly from Anaocha Local Government Area of the state, to join LP after the former governor of the State, Peter Obi, joined the party last week. Obi had resigned his membership from the PDP on May 24. Obi, who was the 2019 running mate to former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, on Monday secured the party’s presidential ticket after Prof. Pat Utomi stepped down for him.
