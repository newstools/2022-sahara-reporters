Amid allegations of vote-buying and inducement by agents of political parties in the ongoing Ekiti governorship election, SaharaReporters has gathered that party agents are also bribing security agents dispatched to various polling units. The essence of bribing security operatives is to buy them so that they will look the other way when the party agents openly induce voters financially to vote for their candidates.

Major political parties including the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Social Democratic Party have been found to be involved in vote-buying. Security officials were sighted at polling unit 001, Ward 4, Ado-Ekiti local government area, surrounding a party agent believed to have been given money for security agents. He, however, refuted the claim saying, ”They said they gave me money for policemen and security, it's a lie, I wasn't given any amount to give you.”Meanwhile, another party agent appeared assuring the security operatives that is a 'special package' at polling unit 001, Ward 4, Ado LGA.SaharaReporters had earlier reported that operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), arrested some persons in connection with allegations of vote-buying.Upon their arrest, the EFCC paraded them at the Oke Ori Omi Area Division of the Nigerian Police Force.The anti-graft agency said some of the suspects were caught with monies allegedly used to induce voters.
