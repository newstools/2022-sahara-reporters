The management of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC) has released a disclaimer after their viral tweet purporting that the All Progressives Congress presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, will pick a Muslim as his running mate for the 2023 general elections. On Wednesday, a Twitter user, identified as Igwe had said, "Tbh the future doesn't look all that bright for Tinubu. He can't run with a Muslim VP and the few Christian choices from the north don't have the required political clout. Interesting to see how this plays out."  But reacting to this tweet, the NNPC on its official Twitter handle, stated that 'He will run with a Muslim VP'.  Due to mixed reactions that trailed this tweet, NNPC via a circular released through the office of Group General Manager, Mr. Garba Deen Muhammad, claimed the organisation's Twitter handle was compromised.  The circular reads: "The general public is hereby informed that @NNPCgroup Twitter handle was compromised and used to send inappropriate messages on 8th June 2022 at 6:35 pm. The breach has been addressed, and the Twitter handle successfully recovered. "NNPC Limited wishes to reassure the general public that it remains committed to doing business in the most ethical manner at all times.” Tinubu on Tuesday won the APC presidential primary election with 1,271 votes to beat his major opponents, former Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi who polled 316 and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, who had 235 votes.
