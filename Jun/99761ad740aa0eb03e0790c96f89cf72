Troops of the Nigerian Army have launched a search-and-rescue mission for a Divisional Police Officer, Gyadi Gyadi, in Pambegua, Kubau Local Government Area of Kaduna State, who was abducted by terrorists. SaharaReporters had reported that the Chief Superintendent of Police was kidnapped on Monday morning along Kaduna-Birnin Gwari Road.  He was said to have run into the gunmen in a community “called Korna Ruwa and was whisked away to an unknown location.” Military sources on Monday night told SaharaReporters that soldiers were combing the area and would leave no stone unturned to rescue the senior police officer. “Our guys are in the bush now looking to see maybe he can be rescued. We got a distress call that a man going to Birnin Gwari was abducted by gunmen, it was when we arrived at where his car was parked that we realised he is a senior police officer,” a top army officer told SaharaReporters. Gyadi’s abduction comes a few days after the Divisional Police Officer in charge of Nasarawa Eggon Local Government of Nasarawa State, CSP Haruna Abdulmalik, was abducted by terrorists. In recent months, Kaduna has witnessed a spate of violent attacks which has led to killings and abduction of residents. On March 28, a Kaduna-bound train was attacked by gunmen, which led to the death of eight people and the abduction of several others. Some of the abducted people are currently in the custody of the gunmen. Days after the train attack, 11 soldiers were killed in an attack by gunmen on a military base in Birnin Gwari LGA of Kaduna State.
