Jamar Ansarul Muslimina fi Biladi Sudan, popularly known as Ansaru, has accused the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) of killing Muslims in the Southern part of the country. The group disclosed this in a video and bulletin about its activities released on Wednesday night.  In the 16 minutes video, Ansaru said the ‘unknown gunmen’ terrorising the Southern part of the country are IPOB members. It also accused the Nnamdi Kanu-led group of killing a pregnant Muslim woman, Harira Jubril and her four children in Anambra State. “Here is some committers of excess known as IPOB. Look at how they have been killing our comrades these days in the Southern part,” the leader of the group said in the video. “Drivers are stopped, ejected from their vehicles and shot, a Muslim woman with her four children were stopped and killed, and then it was reported as unknown gunmen, this is lie. “The organization of IPOB has been supported to kill Muslims, then Muslims, who is yours? Who is it that will protect you?” Ansaru also called on all Muslims to support the group’s cause to fight and defend them from alleged persecution by groups like IPOB. It further denied the attack on an Abuja-Kaduna-bound train in March 2022, which claimed no fewer than eight lives. Many people were in the attack and some of those abducted have yet to regain their freedom. According to the group, its main aim is to protect Islam and Muslims who have been cheated and oppressed, adding that a man called Abu Barra is not its leader.
