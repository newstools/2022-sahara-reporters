A former Deputy Speaker of the House Of Representatives, Lasun Yusuf, has been announced as the governorship candidate of the Labour Party (LP) in the July 16 gubernatorial election in Osun State.Lasun had contested the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship primary on February 19, 2022. The former deputy speaker contested against Gboyega Oyetola, governor of Osun, and Moshood Adeoti, a former secretary to the state government under the administration of Rauf Aregbesola.Oyetola had secured the party’s ticket, but the exercise was not without controversy.The incumbent governor was adjudged to have polled 222,169 votes; his closest challenger, Moshood Adeoti, secured 12,921 votes, while Lasun got 460.Unveiling Lasun in Osogbo on Thursday, LP National Chairman, Barrister Julius Abure berated the past administration of Aregbesola for introducing Opon Imo (Knowledge Tablet) and single uniform policy, describing it as a failed education policy that history would “not readily forget.”He also described the administration as one that Osun people should never pray to have again.“Part of the Civil Service Coalition and many others wrote a petition and even publicly addressed the National Press on the numerous numbers of corrupt practices of one Governor across 2012 to 2015,” Abure said in a speech read by the party’s Publicity Secretary, Comrade Arabambi Abayomi.“In the allegations in some petitions, it was alleged that a sitting governor received money directly from the Ministry of Finance without due process, giving the preparation of the workers' salaries in contract to a Lagos Company.“They also alleged that the governor lied publicly about the accrued state revenue of 4 years. Many of these very heavy allegations were documented by men who are yet living and are Osun State indigenes. In another drama in a press interview, a former yet living APC finance commissioner tried so hard but unsuccessfully muddle up the details of two huge loans of the state that is still unpaid.“Haba! A government wicked enough to order half salary payments to the workers is a very insensitive government.”It will be recalled that Lasun is a top member of Aregbesola’s The Osun Progressives (TOP).
