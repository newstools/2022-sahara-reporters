Human rights activist and Presidential aspirant, Omoyele Sowore, has vowed to wrestle power from the President Muhammadu Buhari-led All Progressives Congress (APC) government and retire all corrupt politicians who have impoverished Nigerians come 2023.Sowore described himself as the best man for the job who would put the country on the path of honour where all Nigerians would have a sense of belonging. He disclosed this during a visit to the members of African Action Congress (AAC) in Orozo community in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, on Sunday. The activist, who was received by a large crowd, said the present government had lost touch with reality and inflicted hardship and pains on Nigerians.Sowore lamented the monumental corruption and injustices going on under the APC government, adding that the time had come for Nigerians to put an end to the shenanigans of the ruling party. The activist while debunking the insinuation that AAC did not have structures across the country said the oppressed and marginalised Nigerians were their structures and were ready to vote out bad politicians who had made life miserable for them.He added that their structures included the oppressed market women, poor people, pensioners, students, unemployed graduates and commercial motorcyclists.He said his agenda was to rescue and salvage the country from total collapse and unite Nigerians irrespective of their religion, ethnic and political affiliations. Sowore also promised to create jobs for teeming unemployed graduates and ensure that Nigerians youths channelled their potential energy toward productive ventures.He maintained that the AAC had structures which cut across all categories of people in the country.He said, “We are going to retire all of them in 2023 and send them back to their villages.  Buhari will go back Daura, Osinbajo will go back to Lagos and do his pastoral work.“They are saying we don't have structures across Nigeria.  Our structures are organic across - the country.  Who are our structures? The poor, oppressed, pensioners, widows, students, commercial motorcyclists, markets women, drivers and others.”He said that he would run a socialist government that would focus on workers’ welfare, free education, job creation, and pension reform.Sowore had on March 1, 2022, formally declared his intention to contest for the position of Nigeria’s president in the 2023 general elections under the platform of African Action Congress (AAC).He had last week visited Tunga Maje and Mpape communities in the territory as part of his engagement with the people.
