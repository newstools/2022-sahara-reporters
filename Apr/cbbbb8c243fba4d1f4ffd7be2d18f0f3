Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has told his counterpart from Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, that he will lose the 2023 presidency. Wike, who is a presidential aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had on Monday visited Kano where he made a courtesy visit to Ganduje, a member of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).  The Rivers State governor speaking during the visit appealed to Ganduje to support his ambition in respect of 2023. Responding, the Kano state governor said, “So, you have come to see your brothers and sisters. Good. You are aspiring for the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. “We see your efforts. And at the end of it, you’d lose, but you’ll be a good loser. I appreciate good losers, because they have courage. And since you are doing it peacefully, you’ll live long to fight again. I congratulate you, Mr ‘Wise’ Wike. Thank you and God bless.” Wike had in 2020 publicly taunted Ganduje, saying he could not influence the Edo governorship election with his ”dollars”. “Yesterday, I was told and today I read on the pages of newspapers that one Governor Ganduje said that he is going to isolate me until the election is over,” the governor had said. “If Nigeria is supposed to be a country, who is supposed to be isolated? A man who pockets dollars in ‘babanriga’ from contractors is not isolated and you say that me should be isolated. In this country, where are we heading to? “Let me tell you why they [APC] made Ganduje the chairman of the campaign council – it is because of the dollars they saw. “What he doesn’t understand is that we are from the Niger Delta; we shall chop his dollar and we will chop him to a coma. So, Ganduje, your dollar will not work in Edo State, we have integrity in our party.” In 2018, videos of Ganduje pocketing a stash of dollars he allegedly received as a bribe from a contractor went viral. https://mobile.twitter.com/baba__________/status/1516158218564743168/video/1
