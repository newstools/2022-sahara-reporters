A 24-year-old Nigerian man, Sobanke Idris Sunday Adereti, has been sentenced to 33 months imprisonment for federal fraud violations by a United States Court. Adereti, who was also identified as a prince pleaded guilty on October 25, 2021, to passport fraud and attempted bank fraud.  He was sentenced to prison on Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Jeremy Kernodle. The Nigerian who is also the son of a traditional ruler, entered the United States on a visitor’s visa in 2018, which has since expired. He was also said to have falsely procured a certified cheque in March 2021 when trying to open a bank account in Flower Mound, Texas. The check was purchased by a fraud victim who was induced into sending money to Adereti, falsely known as “Robinson Elijah.”  Adereti was acting as a money mule to cash the victim’s cheques. Items found on him during arrest include additional passports and bank statements in other names, a statement by the United States Department of Justice noted. Investigators determined that Adereti was also connected to scams related to business email compromise fraud and other government program fraud.  “Scams to steal money are around every corner. Thanks to the keen eye of bank officials, Adereti was apprehended. Unfortunately, many of these crimes target our vulnerable elder population. It is up to all of us to share this awareness and look out for our greatest generation,” U.S. Attorney Brit Featherston said. A federal grand jury returned an indictment charging Adereti with federal violations on April 7, 2021.
