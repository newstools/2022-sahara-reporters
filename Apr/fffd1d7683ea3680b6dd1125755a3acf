A human rights lawyer, Festus Ogun, has sued President Muhammadu Buhari at the Federal High Court in Lagos State for the “excessive pain” Nigerians were put through as a result of fuel scarcity earlier this year.According to the Ogun, Buhari’s dual role as President and Minister of Petroleum Resources should be blamed for the inefficiency and mismanagement that led to the fuel scarcity and long queues at petrol stations nationwide.  Ogun, in a statement on Monday, said, “I solemnly believe that the gross inefficiency and mismanagement in the Petroleum Sector, that led to the fuel scarcity, is avoidable if the President was not holding the dual position of Petroleum Minister in violation of Section 138 of the 1999 Constitution. “I believe that the President’s continuous serving as Petroleum Minister is not only illegal and unconstitutional, it is inimical to our economic growth and likely to occasion future scarcity and inefficiency that will affect the country and its good people. “I make bold to say that it is practically and legally impossible for the President to hold his elected position, which comes with enormous responsibilities, contemporaneously with the position of Petroleum Minister. It has no basis in law, logic and politics.”“If Nigerians suffered that heavily during the fuel scarcity, the President must be answerable for it. There must be consequences. And as a citizen of this country, I believe we must avert a reoccurrence; whether under this regime or in future administrations. God bless Nigeria,” he said.
