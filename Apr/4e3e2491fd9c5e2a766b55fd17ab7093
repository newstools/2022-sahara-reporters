A former Governor of Ogun State, Ibikunle Amosun, has declared his intention to contest for the 2023 Presidential election. Amosun, who is currently the Senator representing the Ogun Central Senatorial District, made his intentions known in a letter to the Senate.  The letter was read on Wednesday during plenary by the President of the Senate, Senator Ahmad Lawan, Vanguard reports. The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) currently has about eight presidential aspirants. Former governor of Lagos State and National Leader of the party, Bola Tinubu broke the ice in January and declared his intention to run for the presidency when he visited Aisha’s husband, Muhammadu Buhari at the Aso Villa, Abuja. The Governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi, followed suit, and in a similar fashion, visited Buhari to inform him of his intention to run for the coveted number one position in the country. It did not take long for others like a former governor of Abia State, Senator Orji Kalu; ex-governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha; Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State; and Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, to declare their interest in the presidency on the platform of the APC. Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo has also joined the race.
