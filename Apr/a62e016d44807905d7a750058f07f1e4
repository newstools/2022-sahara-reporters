The Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC) has described as disrespectful, a proposal by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency to make drug integrity tests part of the screening requirements for aspirants seeking to contest political offices in the 2023 general election.IPAC, which is a coalition of 18 political parties, said in a statement by its National Chairman, Yabagi Sani, that the proposal by the NDLEA was a deliberate attack on the sensibilities of lovers of democratic governance in Nigeria. Buba Marwa, the chairman of the NDLEA on Wednesday, had sought the permission of the ruling APC to conduct drug tests on candidates for the 2023 presidential election.Marwa had stressed that he hoped other political parties would also participate in the exercise.Reacting, IPAC said the proposal suggests that politicians are drug addicts whereas the NDLEA does not have the guts to request the same of security agencies who mistakenly bomb innocent citizens, rather than criminals.The group demanded an apology from the agency, stating that there was no justification for the extra-constitutional requirements as proposed by Marwa.It said, “IPAC demands an apology from NDLEA and strongly warns the anti-narcotic agency to desist from impugning on the character and integrity of politicians including those contesting for president who are patriotic, highly respected, well accomplished statesmen and women with proven integrity. There should be a limit to rascality in the discharge of public duties.“It is amazing that Brig Gen Buba Marwa (retd.), who lacks the audacity to make similar proposal to the nation’s armed forces that have on several occasions “accidentally bombed” civilian settlements killing innocent citizens including children in the course of military operations to get rid of terrorists, insurgents, militants and bandits should target politicians who are working assiduously along with fellow compatriots to build a strong, virile, united, progressive, egalitarian and decent democratic nation.“It is high time we begin to show regard for the nation’s political leaders as obtainable in other democracies. IPAC strongly condemns drug abuse by misguided citizens and urges NDLEA to discharge its duties in tandem with the law establishing it. A nation is governed by the rule of law, not by impunity.”The group further explained that the activities of political parties are guided by the 1999 constitution as amended, Electoral Act 2022, INEC guidelines/regulations and respective parties’ guidelines.“This is the position of the Supreme Court ahead of the contentious 2003 general election where it held that INEC had no power to impose nomination fees on aspirants vying for elective offices outside the requirements provided by the constitution. This is the clear position of the law and the position of IPAC for aspirants seeking political offices in the 2023 general election. Political parties will not be distracted by this absurdity.“IPAC will continue to uphold democratic ideals, ethics and ethos as we jointly build a better, greater and prosperous democratic society.”
