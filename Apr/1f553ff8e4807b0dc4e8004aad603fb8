A civil society group, Talakawa’s Parliament has kicked against the sale of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), popularly known as petrol above the N165 pump price by filling stations in Edo State.According to Talakawa’s Parliament, some Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited branded stations and other major marketers in the state are guilty of doing this.

The group, therefore, demanded the redeployment of Mr. Razak Olaniyi, the NNPC Sales Representative in the state, elsewhere “for his connivance with some NNPC branded filling stations to sell fuel above the official price of N165”.While addressing journalists in Benin, the Speaker Of Talakawa's Parliament, Marxist Kola Edokpayi, said it is only in the state that filling stations sell fuel above the pump price contrary to NNPC rules.The group also called for the resignation of the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Silva, for his “nonchalant attitude towards the plights and pains of the masses in Edo State and his refusal to meet the demands of the group”.It emphasised the need for the state government to set up a Task Force Monitoring Committee to check the excesses of the exploitative petrol stations. The group also wrote to the state governor, Godwin Obaseki, signed by its Speaker, Edokpayi and Secretary, Imasuen Wilson Osawaru, lamenting the situation and calling for his intervention.The letter obtained by Saharaeporters on Thursday reads, “We want to use this medium to bring to your notice the extortion and exploitation of Edo people by some NNPC stations and others who are selling fuels above pump price despite the warnings that Petrol Stations shouldn’t sell fuel about the official price.“Despite the effort of the Group Managing Director of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to ensure that there is product availability and sale to the masses at the regulated pump price especially at all NNPC Mega and affiliate stations as well as by major markers, it came to our notice that almost 80% of NNPC branded stations and others are selling above the pump price ranging from N190 to N220 per litre. “Our independent investigation reveals that the Sales Representative in Edo State is aiding and abetting the sale of fuel above pump price; that is why he is docile and complacent.“Our visit to the NNPC Mega Station at Oluku after Seven-Up Bottling Company revealed that PMS is being sold for N200 per litre, while dispensing fuel with only one pump and they prefer to sell to black marketers in jerrycans. “Another visit to NNPC Mega Station at Upper Mission Extension revealed also that they were selling PMS at N210 per litre. The story was the same in other stations we visited. “Our further enquires led to the discovery that the NNPC station retail outlets that are selling above the pump price have the backing and blessing of the Sales Representative that was supposed to supervise them. In fact, we were told at these stations we mentioned above that they have the blessing and backing of the authority in charge.“But it is pertinent to note that our visit to other major marketers – Conoil, Akpakpava, AP Filling Station, Akpakpava,  and others showed that none of these major marketers is selling above the pump price. This shameful and disgraceful practice is only happening in some NNPC stations and a few other petrol stations in Benin.” “Our investigative finding also revealed that the Sales Representative in Edo State (Razaq Olaniyi) who is supposed to be the eye of NNPC has been fully compromised having spent well over seven (7) years in Edo State.“He has allegedly soiled his hand and entered into an unholy alliance with the NNPC stations for his selfish benefit to the detriment of NNPC and the suffering masses. We make bold to say that your Sales Representative in Edo State is helping to give NNPC a bad name and tarnishing the good work of the Corporation,” it also reads.The group, therefore, asked that the “Edo State NNPC Sales Representative, Mr. Razaq Olaniyi who is extremely taciturn and aloof while Edo people are extorted on a daily basis should be redeployed in the interest of the suffering masses”.It also called on Obaseki to “set up a Task Force Monitoring Committee to monitor and check the excesses, unrestrained behaviour and immoderation of the petrol stations extorting the masses by selling a litre of fuel above pump price”.Lastly, it called on the Minister of Petroleum Resources, Sylva, to “resign his position honourably for his inability to call the marketers extorting the masses to order sequel to the letter that was transmitted to his office”.
