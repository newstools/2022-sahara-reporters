Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter could facilitate the return of ex-US president Donald Trump to the platform, according to a report by AFP.Musk had recently bought the micro-blogging platform for a record $44billion. In January 2022, Twitter had suspended Trump permanently for allegedly using his account to incite violence.But according to the report, the Tesla chief’s deal to acquire Twitter sets him up to revisit the ban on the brash Republican — a move that could roil US politics as the nation marches towards the 2024 presidential race and a potential Trump re-election bid.Trump had earlier said he would not return to Twitter even if offered.On Monday, he told Fox News that he would instead stay on his fledgling Truth Social platform, which has struggled to fully get off the ground.However, many remain sceptical Trump would be able to resist rejoining Twitter if given the chance.Musk has not directly addressed the Trump question.Analysts believe Musk is driven primarily by a desire to control a visible marketing platform more than aspirations to shape American politics.But many read Musk’s criticism of Twitter content policies as suggesting he will lift the Trump ban.“Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,” Musk said on Monday while announcing the deal.
