Hire a lawyer in Finland and sue Simon Ekpa for agitating for Biafra freedom and stop coming to social media court.https://twitter.com/simon_ekpa/status/1515645132011364353?t=N1Mw2D2uGHBIJZ0wdn1l2Q&s=19“The faceless poor igbo group looking for Fulani money could not file any documents to the ICC against Nig for genocidal crime against Ndigbo being committed by Nig state everyday, they could not inform Germany of the ethnic cleansing of Ndigbo, disregard the poor group. I am here.”https://twitter.com/simon_ekpa/status/1515646012395819010?t=wPU-ztL7UQkyuYKgVvhArQ&s=19Some weeks ago, the Indigenous People of Biafra reiterated that Ekpa was not a member of the group.The group further urged Ekpa to stop using the group and Eastern Security Network to defraud unsuspecting members of the public.
