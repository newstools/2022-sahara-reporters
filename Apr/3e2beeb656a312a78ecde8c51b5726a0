The Archbishop Emeritus of the Methodist Church Nigeria, Most Reverend Ayo Ladigbolu, who is from the Agunloye Ruling House of Oyo Kingdom, has said that the new Alaafin of Oyo Kingdom will inherit the wives of the late Oba Lamidi Adeyemi.In an interview with PUNCH, Lagbigbolu said he could not answer whether he was interested in becoming the new Alaafin or if any of his children were interested. He said, “I have said this for the umpteenth time that my culture is me and that is what made me available to the church; my upbringing in the palace during the reign of Oba Siyanbola Onikepe Ladigbolu and Oba Bello Gbadegsin Ladigbolu II, and of course, my closeness to Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, who just passed away. You will see that most of my life has been lived within the palace or within the precinct of the palace. That is what enriched my ministry and what made me Ayo Ladigbolu. I cannot separate myself from the holistic embrace of my culture. But that doesn’t mean that I will tolerate paganism or anything that is not the way of God, like idol worshiping and so on. But my culture is me.”Speaking on the late oba’s wives, he said, “The new king will inherit them and that is the tradition, but you know things are changing now.  Once a woman is married to the Alaafin they are married forever to the Alaafin. You know the circumstances of life are changing and we have to adjust to the changing trends.“They are married to Alaafin and Alaafin is not a person but an institution. The new Alaafin will be responsible for their welfare because they are married to the institution and not just a person.“That is why the question of who they belong to after the death of the Kabiyesi who married them did not arise. They belong to the Alaafin. But in the light of the prevailing circumstances we will have to adjust. That is my response.”
