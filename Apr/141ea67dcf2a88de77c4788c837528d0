Kidnappers, on Thursday morning, released Musa Madaki, a younger brother of the Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kasuwan Magani, Kaduna. Madaki, alongside scores of people, were kidnapped two months ago.  The kidnappers later demanded a huge sum of money as ransom, but as the majority of the Kasuwan Magani residents are peasant farmers, they could not afford the ransom, Daily Post reports. The victims were subsequently held hostage and tortured.But Madaki was released by the kidnappers after he fell ill.A resident in the area, Mose Bulus told the newspaper on Friday that “they kidnapped several of our people last two months. “They demanded millions as ransom. But we are all farmers who could not afford three square meals a day. Even when we begged them, they refused to reduce the ransom to our reach.” According to him, it was when one of the kidnapped victims became sick, and was at the point of death, that they released him. He added that other kidnapped victims were still with the bandits in their den. He appealed to the Kaduna State Government and security agents to intensify efforts aimed at releasing the victims.
