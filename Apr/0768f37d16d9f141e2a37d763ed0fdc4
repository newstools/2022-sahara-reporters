The Alaafin of Oyo, Lamidi Adeyemi, has passed on, a report by PREMIUM TIMES said.  Alaafin Adeyemi, the third from the Alowodu Ruling House, died in the late hours of Friday at the Afe Babalola University Teaching Hospital, Ado Ekiti, Ekiti State. SaharaReporters Media The remains of the top Yoruba traditional ruler was brought to Oyo in the early hours of Saturday and traditional rites began, palace sources revealed.  He was 83 years old and the longest reigning Alaafin ever, having ruled for 52 years.  Governor of Oyo State, Seyi Makinde, is expected to make an official announcement upon receiving the report of the monarch’s passing from the Bashorun of Oyo, Yusuf Akinade, the head of the ‘Oyo Mesi’, who will now lead Oyo before a new Alaafin is installed.  The monarch had been sick and a plan had been made to fly him abroad before he passed on late Friday night.  A source familiar with the medical travel plan said his tickets and those of a few wives were already procured.  His death came after the two other senior Oyo State monarchs – the Olubadan of Ibadan, Saliu Adetunji, and the Soun of Ogbomoso, Jimoh Oyewumi – died.  All happened in less than five months.  A new Olubadan has been installed but the Soun remains vacant.  With the demise of Alaafin Adeyemi, it is now the turn of the Agunloye Ruling House to produce the next Oyo monarch.  Adeyemi’s predecessor, Bello Ladigbolu, was from the Agunloye House.
