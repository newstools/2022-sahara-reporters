Justice Elias Abua of the Cross River State High Court in Calabar has sentenced two former bankers to three months in prison with an option of paying a fine. The convicts, Titus Chima Nwankwo and Utibe-Abasi Ifiok George, were arraigned by the Uyo Zonal Command of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).  The court found the duo guilty of stealing N2,900,000 from the account of a deceased customer, Godfried Francis Osso. Upon their arraignment, they pleaded guilty to separate charges bordering on forgery, conspiracy, breach of trust and stealing. Justice Abua subsequently convicted and sentenced George to three months imprisonment with an option of a fine of N100,000 while Nwankwo was also sentenced to three months imprisonment, with an option of paying a fine of N50,000. A petitioner had alerted the anti-graft agency to the crime, saying the duo had forged the signature of the late Osso and used it to steal the funds.
