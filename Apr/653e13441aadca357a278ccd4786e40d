The Advertising Practitioners Council of Nigeria has described as “insensitive and provocative” an Easter advert by Sterling Bank Plc to its Christian customers.An advert by the bank, with the copy text “Like Agege Bread, He Rose Again” had attracted the outrage of Nigerians who queried the rationale behind the advert. Reacting, APCON condemned the advert noting that the advert copy was not submitted for approval by the Advertising Standards Panel (ASP), the statutory Panel before it was made public.This was contained in a statement on Monday signed by its Registrar and Chief Executive, Olalekan Fadolapo, APCON.The advertising body said Sterling Bank Plc would be punished for the action.The statement reads, “The Advertising Practitioners Council of Nigeria (APCON] has observed with displeasure the insensitive and provocative Easter celebration advertisement by Sterling Bank Plc which compared the resurrection of Christ with Agege Bread.“The distasteful advertisement was neither submitted nor approved for exposure by the Advertising Standards Panel (ASP), the statutory Panel charged with the responsibility of ensuring that advertisements conform with the prevailing laws of the federation as well as the code of ethics of Advertising in Nigeria.“APCON will take necessary actions to ensure that Sterling Bank is sanctioned for the exposure of such offensive advertisement according to law and that no religious belief or faith is ridiculed or any blasphemous advertisement exposed in any guise.”The bank subsequently posted a follow-up advert that reads, “Blessed is the one whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered. We humbly celebrate His resurrection, the defeat of death and the hope of salvation.”Below are some of the reactions to the advert and subsequent apology issued by the company.https://twitter.com/Morris_Monye/status/1515936224111902723?t=TwbR1oj5yYLmHpzgPSjEdQ&s=19https://twitter.com/Yhormite01/status/1515770602648391688?t=_-itG4rnOs_GGWScPAJ3TA&s=19https://twitter.com/RokamoBet/status/1515604117208682497?t=I8_sKx0TlyR59W8_VgTyGw&s=19https://twitter.com/KenUgbechie/status/1515958501977489408?t=9L6Wl2pC7gWaL47wk81Odw&s=19https://twitter.com/Segun_Odunayo/status/1515932619824902149?t=n3wUWcYXB8kw_8gd51A-7A&s=19https://twitter.com/manlikekorex/status/1516036261542248448?t=2Ilp4dF7Qjt9LSOCkqyNMQ&s=19https://twitter.com/abdulrasheed0a/status/1516035773891555330?t=KV9exaOFmH4IRo8UbrrIjw&s=19https://twitter.com/manzoezekiel/status/1516039537985826825?t=kcgcFKxE1U4qsXSQ8mIyVA&s=19https://twitter.com/mona_adejoh/status/1515985886747447300?t=o_cDY_xiMBb53P7L1UJ7lw&s=19https://twitter.com/obasay/status/1515764022934589440?t=UEgYqpaYc7PVO7sGS1BBQw&s=19https://twitter.com/garsity/status/1515705014228074502?t=ZK_5IxSVWvytkimMe-c0qw&s=19https://twitter.com/SolaAyoAderele/status/1515702122892996609?t=BAHtI8_sniE3A361YFTXaQ&s=19https://twitter.com/YWH02/status/1515698874970746887?t=tIFB9Hw2o9ReY_IC9fBiMw&s=19
