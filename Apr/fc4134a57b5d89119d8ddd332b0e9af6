An Application for Mandamus brought by one Chief Edozie Njoku and others against the Victor Oye-led leadership of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) has been dismissed by a Federal High Court in Abuja. The Application for Mandamus vide Suit No. FHC/BAU/CS/10/2020: Chief Edozie Njoku & Ors v Independent National Electoral Commission, was brought by the trio of Chief Edozie Njoku, Barr Hamman Buba Ghide and Adamu Danjuma Musa.  They had asked the court to compel the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to recognise Njoku as the National Chairman of APGA. However, the court presided over by Justice A. R. Mohammed, held that the said suit constituted an abuse of court process and was an exercise in futility.  The court also ruled that it lacked the jurisdiction to dabble in matters connected with the internal affairs of the party.  The judge also said he lacks the powers to sit on Appeal over the subsisting judgments of the Court of Appeal, Kano Division, as well as that of the Abuja Division.  According to the court, the judgment of the Court of Appeal has laid to rest the issue of APGA leadership by affirming Victor Oye as the National Chairman.
