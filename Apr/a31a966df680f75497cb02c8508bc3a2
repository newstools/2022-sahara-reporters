Nobel laureate, Prof Wole Soyinka, has taken a swipe at President Muhammadu Buhari over the latter's inability to come up with profitable ideas to pilot the affairs of the country.The literary icon who spoke on Thursday at a media session titled, “Forget the past, forfeit the future: A nation seceding from humanity”, said President Buhari has run out of profitable ideas and makes the wrong moves at critical moments.

He said the country was being led by a man who was exhausted.Soyinka made reference to Buhari's comment after the murder of over 70 persons by suspected herdsmen in Benue State.He noted that Buhari visited the state and simply asked the Benue people to live in peace with their neighbours without making any meaningful move towards getting justice for the deceased and their families.He said, “President Buhari has failed. Even he will admit that he's tired, he's an exhausted man; there are no more ideas, he made wrong moves at critical moments.“When Buhari went to Benue after the killings, he told them to live like good neighbours, we're talking about farmers that were butchered, driven out of their farms, women who were raped, people who were killed when they attended the funeral of those people by same herdsmen.“I remember giving him a challenge. I said; act as a leader and he gave an announcement that any illegal occupant of any farm should leave within 48 hours otherwise...24 hours passed, 48 hours passed, months and years passed, we're still where we are.”
