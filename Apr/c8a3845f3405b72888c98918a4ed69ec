A mild drama ensued on Monday at the resumed hearing of the murder case of Timothy Adegoke, a postgraduate student of Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), when Magdalene Chiefuna, the second defendant in the matter slumped in the courtroom. The Presiding Judge, Justice Adepele Ojo immediately adjourned the matter to allow the defendant to be attended to.  Chiefuna was said to have slumped when the lawyer for the defendants was arguing over the propriety of handing over the case to the human rights lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN). She was reportedly coughing repeatedly before the court clerk and corrections officials rushed to her side. Last week, the Osun State Government declared Falana as being in full charge of the prosecution of the case involving the murder of Timothy Adegoke. Adegoke was killed last November after lodging in the Hilton Hotel and Resorts, Ile-Ife, Osun State. Police investigations have linked some members of the hotel staff to the alleged murder and accused Adedoyin of moves to destroy evidence. The case was first investigated by Osun State Police Command but was later taken over by the office of the Inspector-General of Police in Abuja. However, it was later moved to Osogbo by the Nigeria Police, after the police filed a criminal charge against the suspects in Abuja. While the police prosecutors were prosecuting the case, the counsel for the family of Adegoke, Falana & Co, held a watching brief for the victim and witnessed the proceedings. However, the Chief Press Secretary to the state governor, Ismail Omipidan in a statement signed by Oluwafemi Akande, the state Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, said the office of Falana had already collected the letter conveying the fiat of the attorney general.
