No fewer than 12 passengers including the driver have been rescued by the Kogi State Police Command from kidnappers along the Anyigba highway.SaharaReporters had earlier reported that at least 15 passengers travelling from Abuja to Anyigba, were kidnapped along Itobe-Ochadamu Road in the state. A source had said armed men blocked the vehicle, ordered the passengers out and took them into a nearby bush.It was learnt that the kidnappers operated for over two hours unchallenged along the axis as calls to police authorities in Lokoja, the state capital, proved abortive.However, the Police Public Relations Officer, SP William Aya, on Thursday in a press statement said "On Wednesday, the command received a report that one Toyota bus with Registration Number Benue 192 XA driven by one Benard Ejeh conveying 16 passengers from Abuja heading for Benue State via Ankpa ran into kidnappers at Ojuwo-Ajebgo village of the Ofu Local Government Area along Anyigba road."Immediately the operatives of the Quick Response Unit stationed at Itobe promptly swung into action pursued the hoodlums into the bush and rescued 12 passengers including the driver while four other passengers are yet to be seen."The rumour making around social media that over 15 passengers are missing as kidnappers stormed the Anyigba-Itobe Highway of Kogi State is not true.“The command wishes to unequivocally that, the report is not only the figment of the imagination of the author but totally false, malicious and highly mischievous.“The Commissioner of Police, CP Edward Egbuka, who was on a visiting tour at Kogi East Senatorial Zone got the information while he was on his way to Ejule, immediately moved to the scene met with the rescued passengers and ordered that they should be moved to Itobe division for debriefing.“The CP immediately deployed a tactical team to the area to continue trailing the hoodlums with a view to rescuing other victims.”
