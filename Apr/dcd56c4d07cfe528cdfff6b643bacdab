Sowore Asks Amnesty International To Close Nigerian Office For ‘Turning A Blind Eye To Human Rights Abuses, Romancing With Oppressors’

1 Week Ago Human rights activists described the latest step by Amnesty International Nigeria as a sign that the organisation never believed in what it has been preaching all along. For instance, an Anambra-based lawyer and activist, Justus Uche Ijeoma, Esq., said, “It is rather unfortunate that Amnesty International Nigeria is engaging in this war of attrition that is further destroying whatever is left of its reputation. “How can the organisation that has all along preached free press, freedom of expression, transparency and accountability be the one seeking and obtaining orders to restrain people from publishing information ‘whether true or false’ about their activities? “What are they hiding? Why the contradictions? Why are they posturing as though they are now promoting opaqueness? What has become of Amnesty International Nigeria is really troubling for those of us that have at one point or the other leveraged on the global brand to advance our human rights work.”   Meanwhile, SaharaReporters has obtained several internal documents including emails from other sources showing how a former female employee pleaded for help from the management after complaining about bullying from Osai Ojigho and the organisation’s Finance Manager, Benedicta Ofili. In the email dated April 29, 2021, the female staff member wrote to her line manager: “Please may I officially request to see a psychologist? I need help. I communicated my concerns to you. Please let me know if this is possible.”  Amnesty International indeed has a history of bullying and staff suicide.  In February 2019, a study commissioned by the rights group reported that Amnesty International has a “toxic” working environment, with widespread bullying, public humiliation, discrimination, and other abuses of power.  The report came after two staff members – Gaëtan Mootoo, a researcher for West Africa, and Rosalind McGregor, an intern in the International Advocacy Programme in Geneva – died of suicide in 2018.   Responding to the development, the then Secretary-General of Amnesty International, Kumi Naidoo admitted that the organisation was “facing an alarming trust deficit”.  “To hear our employees speak of a culture of secrecy and mistrust where discrimination, bullying, and abuse of power have been condoned is profoundly troubling. Unacceptable management practices, attitudes, and behaviors cannot and will not be tolerated at any level in the organisation,” he had said.  It is not yet clear why the international secretariat of Amnesty International is yet to take action on the unfolding scandal in its Nigerian office.
