The Makurdi branch of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in Benue State has been gutted by fire. The branch is situated in the Old GRA area of the Benue State capital.  The fire, which reportedly started from the fuel dome of the bank, quickly became ferocious thus drawing the attention of some workers who immediately raised an alarm. The cause of the incident has yet to be ascertained. However, it was learnt that the fire had been put out. In April 2020, a fire outbreak was recorded at the CBN office in Jos, Plateau State. Three months after, a raging inferno gutted a section of the apex bank in Gombe, destroying the office of the Branch Controller.
