For the umpteenth time, let me state that I don’t believe in one Nigeria. I don’t believe in the 2023 presidential elections. The election will produce a president from the rank of thieves who destroyed Nigeria. I believe dissolution is the answer and not elections.  Nigerian democracy has morphed from a Democracy of People into a Democracy of Naira. Pay-to-play is the pathology at the centre of Nigeria’s undemocratic democracy. Pastor RUGA Yemi Osinbajo has turned the APC primaries into an auction clearinghouse that sells delegates’ votes to the highest bidder.  According to SaharaReporters on April 22, 2022, “Some presidential delegates of the ruling All Progressives Congress in the South-West on Friday went home with N250,000 each after attending a meeting with Vice President Yemi Osinbajo in Ibadan, Oyo State.” “This was what we were giving by Osinbajo today,” a delegate said while showing the money packaged in an envelope,” reports SaharaReporters. SaharaReporters Media Integrity is one of the most important leadership qualities that commits a politician to a cause for a necessary admirable political conduct. Pastor RUGA seeks power either because it satiates his vanity, or he’s using it for his ends. He’s not in for the people as he claims, but for himself. Pastor RUGA’s action lacks integrity and provokes distrust and cynicism about his character. As a pastor, bribing delegates corrupts his discipleship by injecting illicit and criminal money in order to win APC ticket. His anointing portrays him as a hypocrite and a weak-willed pastor.  Pastor RUGA Osinbajo, like his boss in the Aso Rock, Muhammadu Buhari, represents the degradation of trust, integrity, and honesty. Pastor RUGA’s sermon on N250,000 bribery to delegates is an indication that Osinbajo is not different from other aspirant looters from APC and PDP. Nigeria is doomed!  bjoluwasanmi@gmail.com
