The Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja has granted the appeal filed by human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore challenging his stringent bail conditions confining him to Abuja. The judgement which was delivered on Wednesday by Justice Tsammani who led the three man panel described the restriction of the activist to Abuja as a gross violation of his fundamental rights.  The court held that the bail conditions granted by the trial judge, Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu, restricting Sowore to the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) as excessive and stringent. The court therefore set aside the lower court judgment and granted the prayer of the activist to travel out of Abuja but failed to grant him request to travel to the United States of America to see his family. It would be recalled that Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu of the Federal High Court on October 4, 2019, granted bail of N100million to Sowore. Ms Ojukwu said Sowore should produce two sureties in like sum. Of the N100 million, N50 million was to be deposited with the court while the balance was to be put in place should Sowore jump bail. The court said Sowore’s sureties must deposit tax clearance certificates for three years, 2016 to 2018, and documents of landed properties in Abuja. The sureties were also to deposit affidavit of means for their assets. The court ruled that when released after meeting his bail conditions, Sowore should remain in Abuja till the case was determined.
