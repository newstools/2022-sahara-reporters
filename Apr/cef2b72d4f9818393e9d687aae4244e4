A fundamental enforcement rights suit filed by suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari, against National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has been dismissed by a Federal High Court, Abuja.Justice Inyang Ekwo had on March 15 threatened to strike out a fundamental enforcement rights suit filed by Kyari against the NDLEA. He had given the warning following the delay by Kyari’s lawyer, Cynthia Ikena, to serve NDLEA counsel, Joseph Sunday, her further and better affidavit after being served with the counter-affidavit since February 28.At the resumed hearing on Thursday Justice Inyang Ekwo dismissed the suit after counsel for the NDLEA, Joseph Sunday, prayed the court that the matter be struck out.Cynthia Ikena, lawyer to Kyari, was absent, when the matter was called.The NDLEA’s Director of Prosecution and Legal Services, Mr. Sunday urged the court to strike out the suit.However, Justice Ekwo said he was informed that Ikena sent a letter, praying the court for an adjournment.But the letter was not filed by the lawyer and therefore not in compliance with the court rule.The judge directed that the letter be shown to the NDLEA’s counsel.Sunday, who expressed surprise with the development, said he was not copied in the letter in accordance with the rule of the court. He however prayed the court to strike out the matter.After listening to NDLEA’s lawyer, Justice Ekwo struck out the case.Also, the judge, after going into the substantive matter and seeing that parties had joined issues in the suit, went ahead to dismiss the case.
