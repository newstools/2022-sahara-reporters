Sit-at-home in the South-East states in honour of Nnamdi Kanu has been declared by the self-acclaimed disciple of the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Simon Ekpa. Ekpa affirmed that the sit at home would be on May 16, 17 and 18, 2022. Simon Ekpa IPOB had openly declared that no more “sit-at-home” exercises in the region should be obeyed. The sit-at-home exercises have led to the deaths of several people who reportedly defied it. However, in a Tweet on Tuesday, Ekpa said it would go down in the history of Biafra liberation that there was lockdown for 3days demanding the release of MNK. “Get ready for a historic lockdown of Biafraland in the month of May.” “It will go down in the history of Biafra liberation that we lockdown our territory for 3days demanding the release of MNK. Save the following dates: 16th, 17th & 18th of May 2022 will be sit-at-home for MNK.”
