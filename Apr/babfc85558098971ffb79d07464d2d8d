The former interim coach of the Super Eagles of Nigeria, Austin Eguavoen has criticised the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) over the failure of the team to qualify for the World Cup. This is even as he noted that he was not in support of the sack of Gernot Rohr.  Eguavoen said he suggested to the NFF that Gernot Rohr shouldn’t be sacked. On Monday night football on SuperSports, Eguavon said he complained about the timing of Rohr’s departure. Eguavoen replaced Rohr in December 2021, ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations in January. Another former Nigeria international, Victor Ikpeba, said, “Eguaveon was not in support of the decision to sack Rohr.” Ikpeba refused to blame Eguavoen for the country’s failure to qualify for the 2022 World Cup. Ikpeba stated that the NFF should bear the responsibility for the Eagles’ absence in Qatar. In agreement, Eguavoen added, “Yes, I complained about the timing as it was too close to the Africa Cup of Nations.”
