President Muhammadu Buhari’s acclaimed praise singer, Dauda Kahutu, popularly known as Rarara, has spoken against what he perceived as the shortcoming of the current administration in a new song. In the song, he led a group of other prominent Hausa singers under the 13-13 Kannywood.  The news of the new song went viral when his spokesperson, Rabi’u Garba Gaya, posted it on his Facebook page. The singer, who was in 2019 appointed as National Director of Music for the Buhari 2019 Presidential Support Committee, criticised the President for “failing” in his promise to protect lives and property. Some of those featured in the song include; Aminu Ladan Ala, Nura M Inuwa and Ali Isa Jita. A stanza in the songs goes like this, “Only few people now reason with you, insecurity has been on the increase both in cities and villages. What started as a hear-say has become reality. Our wish is to see that we have put things back on track.” Rarara had released songs for some governors in the All Progressives Congress including Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State, Mohammed Badaru of Jigawa State, and Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State. Recall that angry youth in Katsina State attacked the musician while he was shooting a video for the president. According to Katsina Post, the youth attacked the musician at the Central Market in Katsina, the state capital, as he was shooting a video of his latest song “Jahata Ce”. The aggrieved youths, upon seeing the singer, started shouting and condemning him in Hausa language. In 2020, Rarara began a movement asking Nigerians to sponsor his next album (harp-song) with a token of N1000 each. The singer said he wanted the public to sponsor a song that will highlight the achievement of the Buhari-led administration.
