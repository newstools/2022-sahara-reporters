Elected councillors in Benue State have threatened to embark on a one-week protest in Makurdi, the state capital, against the nonpayment of their furniture allowance.  The ex-councillors, under the aegis of “Benue State Councillor’s Forum 2020,” disclosed this in a letter to the Commissioner of Police in the state.  In the letter signed by BSCF Chairman, Matthew Akosu and Secretary, Okita Robinson, the association said the nonpayment of their allowance violated the provisions of the operation guidelines for elected councillors of local governments in the state as revived in June 2020.  “This has become necessary due to nonpayment of furniture allowance to councillors of Benue State since inauguration in June 2020, in violation of the provisions of the operation guidelines for elected councillors of local governments in Benue State, as revived in June 2020.  “The situation is further frustrating in view of several appeals by the leadership of councillors in the State to the Bureau of Local Governments and Chieftaincy Affairs, which has not yielded the desired result.”
