The former Head of State who was the guest of honour said, “I’m proud of what NYSC members in the past and present have been doing and hope you will continue to do it. I hope the NYSC radio and television will be a reliable platform for information dissemination and entertainment.“I want you all (corps members) to go out there with courage and sustain the unity of the nation by performing your duties, I hope our security agencies will do the needful to protect you.”The NYSC scheme was set up in 1973 during the military regime of Gowon as an effort to reconcile and rebuild the country after the civil war.Apart from serving in their various places of primary assignment, corps members are often deployed for key assignments such as working as ad hoc electoral staff during elections.However, some of them have either been killed or endangered in the line of duty.Also speaking, the NYSC Director-General, Major General Shuaibu Ibrahim said, “There is no doubt that the radio and television station will tremendously boost the visibility of the scheme in the media space both locally and internationally.”He called for collaboration and support from the Nigerian public as the stations commenced broadcasting.
