One of the biggest jokes that hit the airwaves this week was that Governor Ben Ayade,Cross River’s worst governor since 1999, declared his intention to run for President in2023. This declaration was a cruel insult on the collective intelligence of not just fellowCross Riverians, but all Nigerians. It is disrespectful for a governor who has failed sospectacularly to declare his intention to inject his failure at every level of national life.Electing Ben Ayade as governor in 2015 was an acceptable mistake, but repeating thatmistake in 2019 was outright foolishness on the part of our people who, despite severalcredible warnings, refused to judge the governor on the basis of his catastrophicperformance during the last four years prior to the election. Without the slightest doubt, Ben Ayade’s declaration for president was partlyprogrammed as a comic relief in a country burdened with heart-rending daily news ofeconomic quagmires and rising cases of terrorism that are gradually becoming a normin what was supposed to be a civilised society.What I do know is that this governor has no genuine plan to run for President, andwouldn’t even win a single ward throughout Nigeria even if he had any intention tocontest the election, with his eight disastrous years in Cross River being a referencepoint. But my gripe is that Ayade ought not announce any declaration for President, andmy reason is because he is the first witness of the seven years of spectacular failure hehas supervised in Cross River State. Of course, his praise-singers may be inclined toargue that the governor has the right to run for any political office he desires. True, butthat right becomes a mirage immediately it is clear that he lacks the capacity and/orcompetence to occupy such office.Ayade’s attention-seeking, risible declaration was a political strategy based on oneweak pillar: to eventually step down to one of his favoured new playmates in the APCwhere he sought asylum since May of 2021, and then be rewarded with a ministerialappointment in the event that dictator Buhari’s “anointed” son emerges victorious in2023.Should this crafty, archaic strategy comes to fruition in line with Governor Ben Ayade’sshabbily written script, Nigerians will certainly not escape the outrageous incompetencefor which the governor’s reign in Cross River is known.During the past seven years, Ayade has led Cross River State through politicalmanipulation, deception and dictatorship; all of which he has tried to cover up with hismedia razzmatazz. Since 1999, there is no governor who has aggressivelyunderdeveloped Cross River State like Ben Ayade and none has wasted more fundsthan he already has, even when he still has one year to leave office.Under Ayade’s reign in Cross River State, cultists and kidnappers continue to roamevery inch of the state freely, abducting, maiming and killing law-abiding citizens withunmitigated impunity, yet the governor receives a monthly sum of N500 million in“Security Votes” that he never accounts for. In November of 2021, a popular radiopresenter, Itiat Zion, was murdered in Calabar, the state capital, near the Governor’sOffice. And just like all other killings in the state, the governor refused to show anywillingness in apprehending these murderers. Meanwhile, please take notice that I didnot use the presenter’s case on the basis that his life was more important than otherswho have been killed in similar circumstances. I simply used it as an example ofAyade’s unwillingness to confront crime in Cross River State.By the end of May 2022, Governor Ben Ayade would have received a total of N42 billionin Security Votes in the event that the state is not owed any outstanding money inrespect of this. He will receive an additional N6 billion before leaving in May of 2023.The question therefore is: why is it that Cross Riverians are not safe on their own soildespite the receipt of this huge amount for security?Defenders of Ben Ayade’s calamitous failure are quick to justify the governor’sineptitude on the basis that security is a challenge elsewhere in Nigeria, but suchdefence is weak and is a further confirmation of the governor’s abysmal reign – agovernor who is only inspired by failure and not success.The fundamental problem is that Nigerian citizens do not demand hygiene from thosejostling to represent them at every political level, which is why individuals such as BenAyade and other conventional politicians whose disastrous performances at differentpolitical spheres are well-known, have the temerity to declare their intentions to occupythe highest political office in Nigeria to commit untold atrocities more than they alreadyhave!Ayade’s aspiration to become a minister in the next political dispensation should worryanyone who is knowledgeable about his lamentable performance in Cross River State.A governor who, for seven years and counting, refused to fix broken school structureswith open roof, deplorable roads and healthcare facilities, and whose colourful promiseswere only actualised in the metaphysical world, will inflict boundless agony on Nigeriansthrough any ministry he occupies. The very thought of it terrifies me!Elias OzikpuPlaywright, novelist, essayist, polemicist, human rights activist, arch-enemy ofthe oppressors
