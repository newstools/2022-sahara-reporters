President Mohammed Bazoum of the Niger Republic has pledged his country’s support to help Nigeria tackle banditry and other security threats. Bazoum said this on Thursday when he visited President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa in Abuja.  According to him, Nigeria’s support towards the multinational joint task force (MNJTF) operation is successful due to Nigeria’s financial intervention. “Let’s say if Nigeria accepts to do the same in the north-west in the fight against insurgency, we will gladly accept because as you know Nigeria almost entirely funds the operations and we will be very happy because that means it will reduce the economic and financial burden of the fight against these bandits,” he said. He said Nigeria and his country must modify their strategies to the emerging security threats in the area. This comes a few weeks after a Nigerian governor, Bello Matawalle, donated five high-tech and fully-equipped security vehicles to the Niger Republic.
