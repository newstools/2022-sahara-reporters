Step after step We ply life’s Road Through dust, through clay Through the airy amplitude of the seamless sky  The winds whirl or whisper In accents so brisk and broad As the roadside grass sways to the rhythm Of seasons which oblivion forgets  From the geography of Pain To the archaeology of Pleasure From the heart which knows And the mind that feels  The Road walks us through Its web of wit and wonder Its house of endless echoes, its poetry A running fare of hint and hyperbole  Pause  Hail, then, this Wayfarer Whose feet bear the dusts of many roads From far desert-fringes to the thirsty ocean Polyglot who savours the glide of many tongues  Confluence of many rivers Whose bridge prolongs the Road Dibia* at the Crossroads who doctors The riddle of the knotty distance  Rain, drought, rain The Road molds the mud, distills the dust Etches your memory on the endless milestone On its epic span. Sun and star en-lamp your path  Step after step after step Echoing footsounds re-mind The corridors of the Moon The Road never forgets  *Diviner-physician, an Igbo word   Niyi Osundare
