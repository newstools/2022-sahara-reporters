Chevron Nigeria Limited (CNL) has denied reports in the media that it is one of the partners hindering the full operation of the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) by not allowing the transportation of third-party gas through its pipelines to increase gas supply to the plant. The Nigerian Government had earlier urged its partners in the NLNG project to allow the transportation of third-party gas through its joint pipelines to increase gas supply to the plant.  Following the refusal of the partners – Shell, Chevron, NNPC and others – to allow third parties to transport gas through their pipelines to the NLNG Trains, the company has been unable to operate at full capacity, thus causing its inability to meet domestic and international gas obligations, the government alleged on Monday. Minister of State Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva in an audience with the new Italian Ambassador to Nigeria, Sefano De Leo, in Abuja, said if the NLNG partners relax their rules, the company will be able to provide gas to help ease European Union’s gas crisis. However, CNL in a statement titled "CNL Reiterates Commitment To Nigeria’s Economic Development" and signed by General Manager, Policy, Government and Public Affairs, Esimaje Brikinn, denied the allegation. The statement noted that CNL is not one of the NLNG partners and is not part of the NLNG gas supplier system.It reiterated its commitment to continue to work with the Nigerian government toward the development of the oil and gas industry and the economy generally. The statement obtained by SaharaReporters on Thursday reads, "The attention of Chevron Nigeria Limited (“CNL”), operator of the joint venture between the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (“NNPC”) and CNL, has been drawn to reports widely circulated in the media on April 5, 2022, alleging that CNL is one of the partners hindering full operation of the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (“NLNG”) by not allowing the transportation of third-party gas through its pipelines to increase gas supply to the plant. "CNL wishes to clarify that the statement must have been made in error as CNL is not one of the NLNG partners and is not part of the NLNG gas supplier system. "CNL reiterates its commitment to continue to work with the Nigerian government towards the development of the oil and gas industry and the Nigerian economy generally.”
