President Muhammadu Buhari has directed security chiefs to rescue all persons abducted during the Abuja-Kaduna train attack and other persons still in captivity.The National Security Adviser, Maj Gen Babagana Monguno (retd.) disclosed this on Thursday after a meeting of the National Security Council presided over by Buhari at the council chamber of the presidential villa. The meeting came about a week after the national council of state met to discuss the country’s security challenges and other issues.In recent times, the Northern part of the country has been experiencing a spike in banditry and kidnapping.Terrorists on March 26 attacked facilities at the Kaduna Airport, killing an airport worker.Two days later, the gunmen blew up rail tracks on the Abuja-Kaduna route, killing eight passengers and abducting many others.According to Munguno, the President was saddened by the security situation in the country and demanded immediate action from the security chiefs.He also called for the strengthening of the nation’s borders to curb insecurity.The national security adviser lamented that without the intelligence and support of the local communities, it would be difficult to tame the rising insecurity in the country.
