Senator Rochas Okorocha, a 2023 presidential aspirant, on Wednesday disclosed that only people like him can decide if the country would disintegrate to pave way for the actualisation of Biafra.The former governor of Imo State, who made this known in an interview with BBC Pidgin, noted the members of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB lack the ability to separate the Igbo from Nigeria as being agitated. He affirmed that the decision was not for their children to make, stressing that what they (the elders) see while sitting down, the children would not see it even if they stand.He said, “Only people like us can decide whether Igbos will leave Nigeria. The decision is not for our children to make because what we see while sitting down, they won’t see when they stand.“These agitators are our children and what we ought to do is to make them understand what they need to know. It will be impossible for me to deny these children and say I don’t know them.”The lawmaker said he decided to run for the office of the Nigerian president because of the economic crisis ravaging the country.“Passion and vision brought me into the presidential race, I’m not happy with the way Nigerians are suffering and the poor people cannot feed themselves,” he added.
