Troops of Nigerian Army have neutralised a gunman suspected to be member of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra and its Eastern Security Network at Ihioma Community in Orlu Local Government Area of Imo State.The Director, Army Public Relations, Brig Gen Onyema Nwachukwu, disclosed this in a statement on Monday obtained by SaharaReporters. He said the gunmen were overpowered after they engaged the troops in a fierce encounter while enforcing “the illegal sit at home order on law abiding citizens going about their legitimate businesses.”The army spokesperson added, “Troops of 34 Artillery Brigade Nigerian Army (NA) on Sunday 17 April 2022 neutralised a member of IPOB and its armed affiliate Eastern Security Network(ESN) at Ihioma Community in Orlu Local Government Area  of Imo State.“Troops on routine patrol encountered members of the irredentist group who fired sporadically at Banana Junction to enforce the illegal sit at home order on law abiding citizens going about their legitimate businesses. The IPOB/ESN criminals on sighting the troops withdrew in a blue Toyota Highlander towards Ihioma community for reinforcement.“In the fire fight that ensued during the operation, one of the criminals was taken out, while others fled in disarray.  Troops are combing the general area in a follow up operations to track down the fleeing dissidents.“Having suffered casualty and effectively denied freedom of action by the troops, the irredentist group have resorted to cheap propaganda to whip up public sentiments by circulating a doctored video on the social media alleging troops complicity in their mindless atrocities. This propaganda should be disregarded in its entirety.”Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) had in December 2020 launched ESN to protect the people of region from terrorists and bandits allegedly trooping in from the North.The IPOB leader had described the outfit as a replica of the Western Nigeria Security Network, also known as Amotekun, earlier launched by the South-West governors to curb insecurity in the region.Attachments area
