Rotimi Akeredolu Shortly after the report, the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr. Richard Olatunde issued a statement attacking the newspaper, claiming Akeredolu “only left for Dubai.” “It is, therefore, glaringly insidious for anyone to claim that a man who was with his brother Governors in Dubai till March 31st, which is exactly one week today, is being hospitalised in Germany. “What exposes this shameful falsehood is the fact that SaharaReporters claimed the Governor was flown out of the country to Germany when in fact, he left for Dubai,” Olatunde had said.
