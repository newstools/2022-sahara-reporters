Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday described the Russian military as the most barbaric and inhumane army in the world that will forever be written in history. President Zelensky said Putin’s army will be marked as a “source of evil” for allegedly targeting the civilian population during the ongoing war. 





Zelensky who made this known in a video address on Tuesday noted that the intensity of Russian troops’ fire towards the regions of Kharkiv and Donbas has “significantly increased.” “Forever the Russian army will be written in history as the most barbaric and inhumane army in the world,” he said. He accused Russia of using all kinds of weapons, including the ones forbidden by international conventions to destroy Ukraine. The President, who has vowed that his country will not surrender any of its parts to Russia, said in Mariupol, that the situation remains “brutal and unchanged.” The president also used the speech to praise his armed forces and people for resisting the invasion as fighting enters its 55th day while renewing calls for Ukraine's western allies to send more weapons faster in order to ensure the Russian army is defeated. If Ukraine had access to the same kinds of weapons being used by Russia, Zelensky said, then 'we would have already ended this war.' Only the West is capable of providing such weapons, he added. He spoke after the Ukrainian military said it had managed to repel numerous Russian advances in the eastern Donbas region on Tuesday, as the opening stages of what is likely to be the war's defining battle gets underway.
