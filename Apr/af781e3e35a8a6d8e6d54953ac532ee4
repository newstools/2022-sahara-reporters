Russia has banned 287 British members of the house of commons from entering its country. Russia had earlier in the month banned Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, and some members of the British cabinet from entering the country. 





Foreign minister Sergei Lavrov’s department in a statement on Wednesday said the sanctions were in response to Britain imposing similar restrictions on 386 members of its own lower house of parliament. A translation of a statement reported by state-owned Russian news agency RIA Novosti said the sanctions were being applied “on the basis of reciprocity”. The country also accused the British government of fuelling “unwarranted Russophobic hysteria”. “In response to the decision taken by the British government on March 11 to add 386 State Duma deputies to a sanctions list, in a reciprocal move, personal restrictions are being placed on 287 members of the House of Commons,” the ministry said. In March, the UK government imposed sanctions on 386 Russian parliamentarians over the country’s invasion of Ukraine. The sanction was imposed on those that voted to recognise Luhansk and Donetsk regions — two breakaway territories of eastern Ukraine — as independent regions.
