Bandits on Wednesday kidnapped an unspecified number of persons from the Ijagbe community in the Mopa-Muro Local Government Area of Kogi State. Sources told SaharaReporters that the bandits hijacked a passenger bus and abducted all passengers on board.  According to them, the bandits also kidnapped occupants of a newly-imported vehicle that was involved in an accident. A source said, “There was a kidnap incident on the highway in Mopamuro local government area on Wednesday morning. The name of the village is Ijagbe, in Mopa-Muro local government area of Kogi State.” While the number of kidnapped persons could not be ascertained, a source said the occupants of the passenger bus were all taken, including those in the car. He also noted that the bandits had yet to establish contact with the families of the abducted persons. He said, “They hijacked passengers of a passenger bus and another car, it was one of these ‘Tokunbo’ (imported fairly used) vehicles; the vehicle even had an accident and crashed into a tree but they still entered and picked the occupants. “It happened yesterday (Wednesday) morning around 7 am. They've not contacted anyone but police and vigilantes are in the bush searching for the bandits and victims.”
