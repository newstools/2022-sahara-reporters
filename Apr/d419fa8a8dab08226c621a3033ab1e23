A Court of Appeal sitting in Kano on Wednesday set aside the judgment of the Federal High Court, Kano which discharged and acquitted a governorship candidate in the state, Abdulsalam Sale Abdulkarim Zaura, popularly known as AA Zaura.  Zaura was prosecuted by the EFCC on five counts before the Federal High Court sitting in Kano.  The Commission accused Zaura of defrauding a Kuwaiti national of the sum of $1,320,000 (One Million Three Hundred and Twenty Thousand Dollars) under the pretext that he is into real estate development in Dubai, Kuwait and other Arab countries.  On June 9, 2020, Justice A. L. Allagoa found the defendant not guilty and discharged him on all counts.  Dissatisfied with the judgment, the prosecution counsel, Musa Isah, appealed the judgment, asking the appellate court to set aside the judgment of the lower court.
