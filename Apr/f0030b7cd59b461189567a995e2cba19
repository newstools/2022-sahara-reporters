I am a bonafide member of the APC and I have no intention of leaving the party.  “All through my political career, I have always remained loyal to any party in which I have found myself. That is not about to change now.  “I want to use this opportunity to once again call on the leadership of our party to urgently and decisively address the issues that have forced some members of our party in Kwara to contemplate leaving the party.”
