Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has advised Nigerians not to vote for presidential aspirants who claim their nomination forms were purchased for them by their support groups.  Presidential aspirants who claimed their party nomination forms were bought by groups include former Vice President Atiku Abubakar; Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal; Governor of Bauchi State, Bala Mohammed; former Senate President, Bukola Saraki; former Senate President Anyim Pius Anyim; and former Governor of Anambra, Peter Obi.  Obasanjo, during a colloquium on Thursday to mark the 61st birthday of Pastor Itua Ighodalo in Lagos, said such aspirants lied to Nigerians that youths bought the forms and therefore do not deserve to be voted into office.  He said how can youths contribute as much as N40 million to buy a form for a politician.  “Today, they are paying N40 million. Some of them (aspirants) even said it is some youths who bought it for them.  “In fact, anybody who would come out to tell you such a lie, you shouldn’t vote for him. Which youths gathered N40m? If you want to buy it, buy it and tell us. You don’t need to lie to us.”
