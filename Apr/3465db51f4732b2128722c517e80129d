A comedian, Debo Adebayo, also known as Mr Macaroni, has lamented the oppression of Nigerians by security operatives who carry out illegal arrests and harass innocent citizens.Macaroni who took to his Twitter handle on Sunday decried the hopelessness of Nigerians whose right to speech is being threatened by security agents who are ready to frame anyone willing to speak against the oppression. The comedian was reacting to several videos shared online of Nigerians complaining of harassment by security operatives.He wrote, “I have seen at least 5 different videos today of security operatives harassing Nigerians. (NPF, EFCC, NDLEA). It’s exhausting really. Especially because when you talk, there are people on standby to accuse you of supporting fraud or drugs. The oppression is too much.“What is more disturbing is that our security operatives know that there are zero consequences for these actions. So why should they stop? We appreciate the good ones among our officers but this harassment and intimidation of the people has to come to an end. Please.”  What is more disturbing is that our security operatives know that there are zero consequences for these actions. So why should they stop?
