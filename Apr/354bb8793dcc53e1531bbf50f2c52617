At least five persons have been killed and property worth millions of naira destroyed, in a communal clash between Yoruba residents and the indigenes of Ibeno in the Ibeno Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State. According to reports, though details are still sketchy, the fracas started as a cult clash before it turned into an ethnic war. 





Sources said the Ilaje people, mostly fishermen, have started fleeing the community through bush paths, while their houses and tents are being looted and destroyed by the hoodlums. A Yoruba indigene living in Akwa Ibom State, Barr. Oluwajuwon Ogunbiyi, told Daily Post that the situation was unfortunate. He called on the state government to set up a committee to investigate the crisis. He said, “It is quite unfortunate that this crisis has led to the loss of innocent lives and destruction of properties. The Ibeno community had been a good host over the decades to both indigenes and non-indigenes. Everybody has been living there in harmony without rancour. “I’m therefore using this medium to appeal for peace and an end to hostilities from both warring parties. I also want to call on the Governor of Akwa Ibom State as well as the heads of all security agencies in the state to intervene in the matter immediately in order to stem these waves of violence.”
