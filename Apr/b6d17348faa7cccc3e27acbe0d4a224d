Civil society organisations in Imo State have rejected a ruling by an Owerri Magistrate Court that two stolen babies be handed back to Chinyere Ohanyere, a suspected kidnapper.Recall that the suspects, 55-year old Chinyere Ohanyere, popularly known as Madam Chichi, and Ngozi Egbuson Ebuzoaju, a nurse, were arrested in October 2021 for alleged stealing and trafficking in two children suspected to have been stolen from a yet to be disclosed location in Rivers State. The suspects were arraigned before an Owerri Magistrate Court in suite nos. OW/54C/2021 between the Commissioner of Police Vs Ebuzoaju, and at Owerri Magistrate Court in suit no. OW/505C/2021 Commissioner of Police Vs Chinyere and Anor, which is now consolidated in suit no. HOW/86C/2021.The suit is between the State Vs 1. Ngozi Ebuzoaju, 2. Anayo Duru, 3. Ohanyere Lilian Chinyere, and 4. Dr. Princewill Mbabie, now pending before an Owerri High Court.The court presided over by Chief Magistrate, Adekibe, had ordered the return of the stolen but recovered babies to Ohanyere on the grounds that there was no other claimant to the babies other than the suspect.Reacting, in a statement issued by Maureen Udeagha, Head, Child Protection and Communication, the CSOs under the auspices of the South- East/South-South Civil Society Forum faulted the judgment stating that the court ignored the fact of the information filed and brought to her notice.They also noted that the case is a subset of the same matter and subject matter (the babies) pending before an Owerri High Court 5, which has a higher jurisdiction.According to the statement, the children were reportedly stolen from Rivers State, so there's no way anyone is reasonably expected to make claim to the children in Imo State.“This is an act short of prudence as the court not only failed to transfer the matter to the High Court 5 where all the other accused including the buyer winner of her judgement whom she gave the children is being heard indeed adjourned to the 12th of April, she also never ordered a DNA test to ensure the child stealer is not given the children," the statement noted.Speaking on behalf of the civil society groups during a media briefing in Owerri, Tombari Dumka-Kote, Founder, Centre for Justice, Empowerment & Development (C4J), said they are displeased with the ruling as it exposes vulnerable children to greater danger of being stolen and trafficked.He also stated that the judgement is an encouragement to human traffickers in and around not only Imo State, but the entire South-East and South-South geopolitical zones of the country.Dumka-Kote said the discharge and acquittal of the suspects by the court, while key suspects in similar case were denied bail, puts the integrity of the magistrate to test, leaving the question of why the hasty ruling by the lower court without granting the application for a DNA test to be carried out to ascertain the claims of the first defendant.He insisted that the court ruling is not in the best interest of the children as enshrined in the Child Rights Act (2003), describing it as an amputation of the judicial system.He said the court had done the biddings of the Imo State Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Cyprian Akaolisa, whose office, after filing a motion on notice at the High Court, had denied same through the Prosecution Counsel.In his reaction, ThankGod Robinson of the South-East/South-South CSOs forum, described the action of the office of the Attorney-General and commissioner for Justice as a deliberate ploy by the Imo State Government to frustrate the matter and deny the infant children justice.Robinson said the forum will file a formal complaint against the magistrate before the Judicial Service Commission, the Nigerian Bar Association to investigate the reasons for the magistrate's hasty and unprofessional ruling on the matter without a DNA test carried out on the children, while the same action is going on at the High Court 5.
