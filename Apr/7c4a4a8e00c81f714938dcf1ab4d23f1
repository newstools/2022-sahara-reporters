A conduct of drug tests has been requested to be part of the screening of the ruling All Progressives Congress candidates for the 2023 presidential election.Buba Marwa, the chairman of the National Drugs Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) on Wednesday said he had asked for the permission. Marwa made this known while speaking at an award event for NDLEA officers in Abuja on Wednesday afternoon.Former Lagos State governor, Bola Tinubu, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Ministers of Transportation as well as Labour and Employment, Rotimi Amaechi and Chris Ngige, are among several other APC presidential aspirants who have signified interest.Marwa stressed that he hoped other political parties would also participate in the exercise.How Marwa planned to carry out the exercise was not immediately clear, but his proposal might be due to previous charges of drug use among politicians.Femi Babafemi, a spokesman for the NDLEA, said that additional details of the drug test for politicians would be made public later.
