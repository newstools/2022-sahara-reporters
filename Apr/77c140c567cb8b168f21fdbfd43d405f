The Islamic State-backed faction of Boko Haram, the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), formerly known as Jamā'at Ahl as-Sunnah lid-Da'wah wa'l-Jihād on Wednesday night attacked Geidam community in Yobe state. Geidam, which is the hometown of the Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali-Baba and located 177 kilometres away from Damaturu, the state capital, shares a border with the Niger Republic and Damasak.  Nine villagers were killed and the Government Technical Secondary School in the village was razed, witnesses and security officials said.  The insurgents were said to have come by foot at around 9 pm and moved straight to a drinking joint located at Kwari ward, where they slaughtered the victims and injured two others. “They came into the community unawares as there was no gun battle, executed their mission and left,” a resident said. Since the death of JAS leader, Abubakar Shekau, ISWAP has been consolidating its grip in the North East. The sect’s membership has swollen with the defection of hundreds of Boko Haram fighters under Shekau. The Nigerian army has repeatedly claimed that the insurgency had been largely defeated and frequently underplays any losses. The terror group has caused the death of tens of thousands of people and displaced millions of individuals mainly in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe states. It has also increasingly targeted farmers in their violence. They accused them of spying and passing information to the military and the local militia fighting them.
