Chris, the abducted son of the Deputy Senate President's senior legislative aide, John Oghojafor, has been released.Chris, a final-year student of the Delta State University, Abraka, was abducted by gunmen on Friday in Abraka, Ethiope-East Local Government Area of the state. He regained his freedom around 10:00 pm on Monday, SaharaReporters reliably gathered.  Chris' abductors had demanded a ransom of N50 million but it was later negotiated to N3 million.  Confirming the release of his son, John Oghojafor, a veteran journalist and legal practitioner, said, "My son, Chris Oghojafor, who was kidnapped in Abraka by Fulani herdsmen, since Friday evening, has just been released now. Glory be to God."However, it was not clear if the N3 million ransom demanded by the abductors was paid, but SaharaReporters reliably gathered that the immediate past governor of Delta State, Emmanuel Uduaghan and a former commissioner for economic planning, Bernard Okumagba played vital roles that led to the release of the abducted student of the state university.A journalist and legal practitioner, Akpokona Omafuaire and colleague of the victim's father, told our correspondent the roles played by the immediate past governor and the former commissioner."A special thank you to His Excellency Dr. Emmanuel Eweta Uduaghan and Chief Bernard Okumagba, two men with beautiful hearts for coming to the aid of my senior learned friend, John Oghojafor, whose son was kidnapped on Friday evening by Fulani herdsmen at Abraka who has just been released. Thank you my Oga, Asamaigor, God bless you and your family, Sir, words are not enough to appreciate you, migwo, migwo, migwo sir," Omafuaire said.
