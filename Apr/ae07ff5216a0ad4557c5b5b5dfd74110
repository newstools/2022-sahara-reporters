A Federal High Court in Abuja has fixed June 2, 2022, to hear various applications in a suit seeking the extradition of Abba Kyari, the suspended deputy commissioner of police (DCP). The matter was adjourned by Inyang Ekwo, presiding judge, on Wednesday, after Pius Akutah, counsel for the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami asked the court for more time to enable parties to respond to processes served on them. He noted that he had filed a motion for an extension of time on April 19. Mahmud Magaji, Kyari’s counsel, did not object to the application. The judge then adjourned the matter until June 2 for a hearing. On March 23, the matter was stalled following the AGF’s failure to serve court processes on the defendant.Kyari has been declared wanted in the United States over alleged conspiracy to commit wire fraud, money laundering and identity theft.In July 2021, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) indicted Kyari in a $1.1 million fraud involving Ramon Abass, aka Hushpuppi, a self-confessed international fraudster. And a US district court for the Central District of California had issued a warrant for his arrest.Kyari, who has denied the allegations, has since last August been suspended by the Police Service Commission as a deputy commissioner of police and head of the Intelligence Response Team (IRT).This followed the recommendation of the Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba. The police chief recommended the suspension as a temporary measure while the police investigate Kyari’s relationship with Hushpuppi.Meanwhile, Kyari is also facing trial regarding alleged drug dealing in a case filed by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA).
