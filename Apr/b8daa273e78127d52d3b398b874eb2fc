A civic group, the Take-It-Back Movement, has called for the immediate arrest and prosecution of the Delta State Commissioner of Police, Ari Mohammed Ali, over his alleged involvement in child trafficking, banditry and terrorism acts allegedly committed against children in the state.The group in a letter addressed to the Delta State Coordinator, National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) in Asaba and copied to the Executive Secretary of the Commission and the Inspector-General of Police, stated this. According to the letter, the CP allegedly supervised the trafficking of thousands of children in Delta State with the latest being in February 2022 in which the CP, alongside Oghenekevwe Agas, the Permanent Secretary of the Delta State Ministry of Women Affairs supervised the re-trafficking of 22 children.The group noted that the CP had refused to deal with a petition titled “Re: in the case of the alleged abduction and trafficking of over ten thousand children through the Delta State Police Command” as ordered by the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba.It further alleged that police stations and commands under the CP were responsible for the transfer of exploited children from their custody to child trafficking centres also known as “Orphanages” or “Orphanage Homes” illegally approved by the Ministry of Women Affairs in Delta State.The letter reads, “The Take It Back(TIB) Movement is committed to the protection and prevention of flagrant abuses of the rights of Nigeria’s citizens as enshrined in and the guaranteed by the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended). Also, to establish a system of prompt and efficient assistance for the needy persons whose rights are being violated.“We are calling for the immediate arrest and prosecution of the Delta State Commissioner of Police, CP Ari Mohammed Ali over allegation of massive child trafficking, banditry and terrorism allegedly committed against children in Delta State on the following grounds:“That via a letter dated 14/10/2021, referenced CB: 7000/IGP.SEC/ABJ/VOL.557/184, the Inspector-General of Police had ordered CP. Ali Mohammed Ari, Commissioner of Police, Delta State Police Command to deal with the content of the aforesaid Petition titled “Re: in the case of the alleged abduction and trafficking of over ten thousand children through the Delta State Police Command” but has refused to carry out the said order to date. Find attached and annexed the said letter as Annexure Q1.“That via another Petition dated 11/11/2021 addressed to the Inspector-General of Police, we have also complained about the unprofessional conduct of CP. Ali Mohammed Ari of refusing to carry out the order of the Inspector-General of Police with respect to the aforementioned Petition. Find attached and annexed the said letter as Annexure Q2.“That the claim of CP. Ali Mohammed Ari that most of the Police stations and commands in Delta State do not have records of children is very worrisome because these police stations and commands are responsible for the transfer of exploited children from their custody to child trafficking centres also known as ‘Orphanages ‘or ‘Orphanage Homes’ illegally approved by the Ministry of Women Affairs in Delta State.“The conduct of CP. Ali Mohammed Ari is not only unprofessional but centred on acting against the interest of children in Delta State.“That CP. Ali Mohammed Ari appears to be fraternizing with suspected child traffickers, bandits and terrorists who are mainly Delta State government officials including Mrs. Oghenekevwe Agas, Mr. Joshua Omorere and others who had infiltrated the Delta State Police Command to cause the disappearance of thousands of children from Delta State.“That we cannot condole the conduct of a commissioner of Police who is working against the interest of children by conspiring to traffick them using the machinery of the Nigeria Police Force and at same time displaying utmost disregard for the Order of the Inspector-General of Police.“That on/about the month of February 2022, CP. Ali Mohammed Ari conspired with Mrs. Oghenekevwe Agas, Permanente Secretary, Delta State Ministry of Women Affairs supervised the re-trafficking of 22 children who were victims of child trafficking apprehended at various spots in Warri by failing to take the affected children into Police Emergency Protection thereby contravening  Section 44 of the Child’s Rights Act 2003.“That on /about 23 June 2021, CP. Ali Mohammed allegedly supervised the re-trafficking of Jamina Shagari ‘F’ ‘16years’ and three other children. by failing to take the affected children into Police Emergency Protection thereby contravening Section 44 of the Child’s Rights Act 2003.“It is very pertinent your office swiftly investigates the content of the Petition with a view of arresting and prosecuting the Delta State Commissioner of Police, CP Ari Mohammed if found wanting and preventing further breakdown of law and order.“Take notice, the said CP Ari Mohammed has hired the services of killer police officers, suspected bandits and terrorists including the notorious Divisional Police Officers(DPO), Ovwian Police station and the Area Commander Burutu, SP Samuel Yohanna and ACP Adetoye Adepegba respectively to frame up, kidnap and assassinate Comrade Ighorhiohwunu Aghogho.”
