Nigeria Police Force junior personnel have berated the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba for sacking their colleagues. SaharaReporters had reported that nine policemen were sacked over allegations that they were the ones demanding wage increments and planning to lead the rank and file into industrial action.  Those policemen affected by the sacking were two Inspectors, five Sergeants and two Police Constables.  Their sacking was conveyed through a police message exclusively obtained by SaharaReporters and signed by the Commissioner of Police Provost, Force headquarters, Abuja on April 4.  The dismissed policemen are AP/ NP 287568 – Insp Amos Nagurah; AP/No. 245800 – Insp Nanoll Lamak; F/No. 495378 – Sgt Emmanuel Isah; F/No. 442680 – Sgt Franklin Agughalu; F/No. 508168 – Sgt Adesina Ismail; F/No. 271367 – Sgt Onoja Onuche; F/No. 508282 – Sgt Osoteku Ademola; F/No. 525839 – Police Constable Ehighamhen Favour Ebele and F/No. 528222 – Police Constable Ubong Inem.  They were sacked for alleged “discreditable conduct, improper conduct, breach of confidence, to wit: planning, organising, coordinating industrial strike within the ranks of the Nigeria Police Force.”  Speaking to SaharaReporters, one of the leaders of the aggrieved officers lambasted Baba for the action.  He accused the IGP of deceiving the personnel.  “The officers arrested and sacked were not even actively involved in planning the strike. They are just being made scapegoats,” he said.  “We advise the IGP to urgently recall them to resume their duties without further delay.  “As I told you, 98 percent of police officers in Nigeria are in support of our planned strike. I wonder why they singled out those innocent officers for dismissal. They should dismiss all of us.”
