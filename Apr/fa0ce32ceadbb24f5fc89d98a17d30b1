About 10 persons reportedly die of malaria every hour in Nigeria, a National Malaria Elimination Programme report has revealed. While commemorating World Malaria Day on Monday, the Adamawa State Ministry of Health, said 90,000 malaria-related deaths are recorded annually in Nigeria.

The Commissioner of Health, Abdullahi Isa, warned that malaria remains a major public health burden globally, with most cases reported in sub-Saharan Africa. He said, "Recently, the National Malaria Elimination Programme revealed that over 90,000 malaria-related deaths are recorded in Nigeria, every year. Nigeria accounts for about a quarter of the global burden of malaria, with 9 to 10 persons dying of malaria or malaria-related causes every hour." He, however, noted that the prevalence of malaria was declining as shown in national surveys from 27 percent in 2015 to 23 percent in 2018. Malaria, he further noted can be prevented through seasonal malaria chemoprevention administration for children under five years. "Adamawa State government has been providing all the needed counterpart funding to support malaria elimination programmes," Isa said.
