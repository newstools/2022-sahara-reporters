The incident occurred a few hours after the prayer session organised by Governor Chukwuma Soludo of Anambra State to counter the “evil” effects of the Monday’s sit-at-home order.Soludo had said the prayer session would work against the activities of the gunmen terrorising the state and the South-East region.He said, “I enjoin you to pause and join in fellowship as we seek the face of God. It is expected that the conclusion of the prayer session shall mark the end of Sit- At-Home in Anambra State.”However, only a few people turned up for the prayer session.Residents of the state observed the weekly sit-at-home ritual as they boycotted the prayers.
