Personnel of the Nigerian army have intercepted a vehicle allegedly conveying millions of naira and other items to bandits as ransom to secure the release of kidnapped victims. In a trending video of the incident, a soldier was heard saying N100 million was found in the vehicle registered in Kano with ‘FGE-959TC’.  SaharaReporters could however not confirm when and where the video was shot. Pointing to the boot of the red car, a soldier said in pidgin, “All na money, them they carry am go give bandits, even this bag here, all na money, see this Indomie (noodles) carton, na money full am. Na money full the whole motor, N100 million ooo. (It’s all money that is inside. It is being taken to bandits as a ransom for kidnapped victims. These cartons of noodles are full of money; N100 million).” Northern Nigeria is currently under attack by terrorists who kill and kidnap helpless Nigerians. Many lives and property have been lost and a large number of citizens have been displaced by the activities of the terrorists.  Last Monday, terrorists attacked a Kaduna-bound train with hundreds of passengers on board. During the attack, many passengers were kidnapped. Eight passengers were confirmed killed and 26 injured in the attack.
