Uba Sani, Senator representing Kaduna Central District in the upper legislative chamber, has condemned bandits attacks on various communities in the 23 local governments of Kaduna State.Sani disclosed this while donating relief materials to support victims of banditry in Giwa and Kaura local government areas. The lawmaker's action came on the heels of a devastating terrorist attack on the Abuja-Kaduna train, leading to loss of lives and injury to many passengers.He said the unrelenting attacks calls to question the strategies and tactics being adopted by security forces.“We expected that with the declaration of bandits as terrorists, they will be degraded in no time. This appears not to be happening,” he said.While distributing the relief materials, which include gallons of palm oil, bags of rice, cartons of noodles, mats, blankets and other food items, the lawmaker sympathised with the people affected in these communities and prayed God to grant them the fortitude to bear the pains of their lost ones.The team that delivered the materials to Kaura was led by Engr Namadi Musa, former Director-General of Interfaith, Kaduna State accompanied by a former Chairman Kajuru LGA, Cafra Caino, and the Jaba LGA Chairman, Ben Jock. Others in the delegation were Banta Bala Bantex, Donatus Adamu, Joy Akut and Saratu Abdulazeez. The materials were delivered to Giwa by a former Speaker of the state Assembly, Bashir Zubairu Birnin Gwari, accompanied by the Vice Chairman of Kaduna North, Nazir Sunusi, Engr Jamil Ahmad Muhammad, Ibrahim Shehu Haske and Alhaji Ibrahim Musa.  The delegation was received by Chairman, Giwa Local Government council, community leaders and other party officials and guided to the various IDP camps provided for the victims to distribute the materials with them and condole with them on the unfortunate event.Sani had earlier moved a motion at the National Assembly calling for an order that will allow the military to carry out unhindered operations to wipe out the criminal elements from their enclaves during which he expressed deep sadness and pain at the incessant attacks on innocent citizens and their properties.
