Nigeria's Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba has bought the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC’s) nomination and declaration of interest forms for the 2023 presidential election.According to reports, a group, Project Nigeria pooled resources for the Minister to obtain the form. His decision has started drawing criticism from many public commentators who believe it is insensitive considering Nigerian students who are currently at home due to a strike occasioned by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU).Chris Ngige, the Minister of Labour and Employment; and the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, are some other ministers who have officially declared interest in the 2023 presidency.Meanwhile, the All Progressives Congress has insisted that all its members currently holding political appointments and seeking participation in the party’s forthcoming primaries must quit their positions.According to the party, the move is in line with the provisions of the Electoral Act.Section 84 (12) of the Act stipulates that political appointees, including ministers, commissioners and special advisers should quit to be eligible to participate either as delegates or contestants at the convention of their political parties.
