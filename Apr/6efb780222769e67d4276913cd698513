Residents of the community said the kidnappers stormed Okoriko’s residence and whisked him away in the presence of his family members. “The heavily armed men whisked him away after they scaled the fence and shot sporadically before dragging him into the nearby bush,” one of them said. It was learnt that the whereabouts of the abducted priest is unknown, as kidnappers have yet to establish contacts with the family or with the church.
