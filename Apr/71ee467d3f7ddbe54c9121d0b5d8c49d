Governor Chukwuma Soludo of Anambra State has directed the people of the state to observe a one-day prayer to counter the “evil” effect of the Monday sit-at-home order.  However, SaharaReporters observed that residents of the state observed the weekly sit-at-home ritual as they boycotted the prayers.  Soludo, on Saturday, ordered the prayer session which he said will work against the activities of the gunmen terrorising the state and the South-East region.  He said, “I enjoin you to pause and join in fellowship as we seek the face of God. It is expected that the conclusion of the prayer session shall mark the end of Sit-At-Home in Anambra State.”  But residents avoided the prayers as the governor and only a few other persons were sighted in the church.  From photos shared on social media, the governor, government officials and a few other persons were sighted offering prayers in an almost empty church.  The mass which was held at the St Joseph Cathedral, Ekwulobia, Aguata Council Area, started at exactly 11:00 am and was celebrated by the Catholic Bishop of Ekwulobia Diocese, Most Reverend Peter Okpalaeke.  Since his swearing-in ceremony, the governor has been finding a lasting solution to the sit-at-home ritual in the state, which he said has been drawing the state, and the South-East region back economically.  Last week, Soludo ordered all public servants in Anambra State to always report to work on Mondays, like every other weekday.  However, only a few of the workers have complied with the governor's directive as the level of compliance is still relatively low.  A source told SaharaReporters that only a few public servants resumed at the state secretariat, Awka.  According to the source, some offices were opened in the state secretariat but the principal officers were not in their offices.
