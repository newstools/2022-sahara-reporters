Nigeria's Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami has dismissed the video where he declared interest to contest the Kebbi governorship election.  In a video captured and posted by Arise TV on Tuesday, Malami was heard saying he had thrown his hat into the ring.  “If God in his mercies permits, and all goes well, I will as a politician contest the governorship of Kebbi state. I am seeking your support,” Malami had said.  Reacting in a statement by his Special Assistant on Media and Public Relations, Dr. Umar Jibrilu Gwandu, the Chief Law Officer said the video was “mischievously translated with fabricated insertions and interpolations that cannot in spirit and context establish the malinformation circulated.”  He added, “The clarification became necessary in view of a false and fabricated publication in some section of the media.  “Gwandu said the declaration to contest for a political position was never a hidden affair or clandestine operation that could be reported as a scoop by a section of the media. He said the report was triggered out of curiosity and eagerness by followers and loyalists.”  Malami’s denial comes amid backlash that trailed the publication.  Prior to the video, the AGF has been fighting relentlessly for the deletion of section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, which mandates the resignation of political appointees seeking political office in an election.
