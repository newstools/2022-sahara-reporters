A wire fraud suspect, Adedunmola Gbadegesin, has been extradited to the United States where he is wanted in a case of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering. Gbadegesin, who was arrested on September 2, 2021, is alleged to have defrauded an American woman living in Kentucky, US of over $148,000 (N61.5 million based on the official rate of N415.42 to $1). 





The spokesperson for the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Wilson Uwujaren said his extradition was coordinated by the agency following a request from the office of the Attorney General of the Federation. This in turn followed a February 11, 2022 Order by Justice D.E Osiagor of the Federal High Court, Lagos, in Suit No. FHC/L/CS/765/21, he said. The suit granted a request to extradite the suspect to the United States to answer for criminal charges bordering on a romance scam, wire fraud and money laundering. Upon arriving in the United States, the suspect is billed to appear before a United States District Court for the District of New Mexico, where two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering have been filed against him.
