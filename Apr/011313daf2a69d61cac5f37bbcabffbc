Some kidnapped victims of the ill-fated Kaduna-bound train have cried out in captivity, urging the Nigerian Government to expedite rescue action. In a viral video, some of those abducted spoke from their captors' den, calling for an action to free them from the bandits' captivity.  Speaking in Hausa, an elderly kidnap victim said there were women, children and the elderly among those held hostage. "We're among the passengers on board the Kaduna-bound train that was attacked on March 28, 2022. Amongst us are children, women and the elderly. "What's pathetic here is that quite a number of persons here in captivity are sick and the number is rising by the day. "We need you out there, our friends, family members to coordinate and get the government to act so we can be freed by those holding us. "Yes, please do that immediately because we're facing hardship, unimaginable hardship; our situation is truly a desperate one. "We're therefore pleading with the federal government and desperately so, to do the needful to get us back home please," the victim pleaded. Another victim about the same age says, "We understand that these people have some kind of grouse against the authorities. "Consequently, they have some demands, of which I think the government is aware. Therefore, why not meet those demands to get your citizens freed from them?”The attack and abduction, which occurred on March 28, have continued to elicit concerns over the level of insecurity in the country. The Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) had confirmed eight deaths, while many persons were declared missing.  The terrorists had earlier released the acting managing director/chief executive officer of the Bank of Agriculture (BOA) Alwan Hassan, citing the Ramadan season and old age as the reasons why he was freed.
